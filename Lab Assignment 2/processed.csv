5,i know the product title says molecular gastronomy but dont let that scare you off i have been looking for this for a while now not for food science but for something more down to earth i use it to make my own coffee creameri have to have my coffee blonde and sweet but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat and honestly i hate to use manufactured food items i really dont think they are good for the body on the other hand i hate using cold milk or cream because i like hot coffeei stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer i also bought lowfat noninstant milk powder and regular milk powder the noninstant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant lowfat milk but does not dissolve good in cold water which is not a problem for hot coffee you will have to play with the ratios i would not do just the heavy cream it made the coffee too rich also i think the powder is too expensive to just use on its own i like mixing of each togetherfor flavoring i bough cocoa bean powder vanilla bean powder and caster superfine sugar i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers if you wanted you could use a fake sweetner powder instead i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars i also use my little food chopperfood processor to blend everything so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom let it settle for a bit before opening the top thoughthis stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolateorange mixall of the ingredients i mentioned are here online take the time to experiment maybe you dont use any lowfat milk or dont add any flavorings it is up to you also would make great housewarminghostess giftsi am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great,"['know', 'product', 'title',

5,this packet of glaze is the secret to making those european style fresh fruit tarts i am about to make one for a pie auction at church after a friend requested that something strawberry should be offered you can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base layering it with uncooked fresh sliced fruit then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets they harden up at room temperature hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through ive also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes to hold a fruit topping in place personally i do not like cheesecake too rich for me but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous i will admit to do this slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan pour on the glaze let it set up and then remove the springform youll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake cherries strawberries or sliced mangos are nice but the best one i ever had used thin slices of lemons that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cakei use a base of sponge cake baked in a shallow form but other bases can be pate sucre a kind of french pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie that works well in those fluted straightsided forms you can also make minitarts in a muffin pan prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works though again i prefer pate sucre it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb just blindbake the muffin tins lined with pate then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits berries are great and pour over the glaze some people put a layer of creme patisserie which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour below the fruit and i happen to think these taste bestif you get into baking this glaze is a musthave on the shelf the ingredients are vegan tapioca starch carrageenan dextrose cream of tartar locust bean gum so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake you can use this on top as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base,"['packet', 'glaze', 'secret', 'making', 'european', 'style',

1,i once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy i discovered them when i was in england back in and quickly became a fan about a year ago i picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket i was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it after opening the bag i found the chips were not even close to the kettle chips i was used to they were all uniform whitish yellow in color flavor was way off the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and i was very disappointed so i emailed kettle with the following what happened i bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste it tastes cheaper i dont know how else to put it i also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as i did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor i am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product did i just get a weird batch i have been buying only kettle chips for about years now so i am wondering i did receive a reply thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brand chips it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections and we apologizeour potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in colorbut our chips should still taste greatthanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag this really helps when passing on your comments to our staffwe are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand flavors or nut butters believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase in case you buy this product again we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same timethanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within weeks please let me know if i can be of any more help well the next bag was good since that time i have picked up bags of chips all were like the bad bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company so the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at kettle acquire company with high quality brand recognition sell product to mass merchants lower qualitycost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same,"['loved', 'chip', 'chip', 'would', 'buy', 'discovered', 'england', 'back', 'quickly', 'became', 'fan', 'year', 'ago', 'picked',

5,i was getting very worried when i read some of the other reviews here specifically the one star reviews to which i always go to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying itwow they sure seemed to hate the kettle chips backyard barbecue ounce bags pack of that i had bought as ounce bags liked a lot decided to subscribeand then for good measure got orders of the ounce bagsyesi love potato chipsespecially these kettle chips backyard barbecue flavourbut others seemed to really hate themor at least hate how they had changedbut then i realized they were talking about other flavours amazon in its deep wisdom has obviously seen fit to put all comments concerning all flavours of kettle and other brands of potato chips togetherof course this does have some advantages because most potatochip lovers like me enjoy eating several flavour and brand varieties so comparisons can be made easily also as were all potatochip lovers but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing we are here a sort of united nations of potato chip loversall different but all united in our love of potato chips the rest of the world can really benefit from the example of our tightlyknit but evererexpandinggroup here i think but not at first realizing that thesedifferent flavour reviews were all together did cause me a little confusion and dismay at least to begin with amazon should have mentioned that this is the kettle potato chip review forum i am happy to report that kettle chips backyard barbeque flavour are totally delicious at least they are in the oneounce bagshopefully the same product in the ounce bags will taste the same these are definitely chips for adults however andor children whose strongerthanadult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips they are not the strongest flavour i have ever hadthat was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even methese backyard barbeque chips by kettle however have just the right amount of sweetness with honey powder onion and sugar to take the edge of the stonger flavourspaprika chili pepper cayenne pepper and natural smoke flavour of which there is less they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweetenersthe complete list of ingredients of these kettle backyard barbecue chips in the ounce bags and hopefully in the ounce bags as well is as followspotatoesvegetable oil safflower and sunflower oilhoney powder dried cane sugar honeyrice powdersugarsaltonion powdertomato powderpaprikatorula yeastgarlic powderchili peppercitric acidcayenne pepperpaprika oleoresin colournatural smoke flavournaturally cooked natural ingredients the combination is a true taste treatof course as with all ptato chips moderation is the keypotatoes contain a lot of potassiumwhich gives energy and othr good thingsbut too much of which can damage kindneys the vegetable oil is great but too much oil as well as too much starch from the potatoes can hurt the eyes natural smoke flavour is so yummybut it as well as sugar has in very large amounts been linked to cancer productionas far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go thiscan be ameliorated a bit by drinking teawhich is good for the eyes but as far as the potassium energy good too much bad for the kidneys and the sugar and natural smoke flavour too much leading to cancer production the only thing is to do what is good in everythingm o d e r a t i o ntwice or three times a month i allow myself to go on what i call a potato chip diet i eat only one large bag or the equivalent in small ones of potato chips all day i supplement this with tea coffee and lemonade as well as several servings of carnation instant breakfast essentials i like the dark chocolate flavour this adds up to fewer calories than i would normally eat if i had my normal three meals a day plus snacks it also teaches me to eat slowly because that one big bag or many little bags never lasts as long as id like anyway with excercise and sensible eating the rest of the month and keeping my scale nearby and weighing myself at least twice a day every day ive taken off ten pounds in the last three months these backyard barbeque flavour potato chips from kettleare totally scrumptious except for those jalapino chips which tasted good but were far too spicy for my own taste buds i have yet to meet a potato chip i didnt like to eat these kettle backyard barbeque flavour potato chips with their combination of potatoes sweetness

add this to kombucha maximizing its longevity that way ive tried many but this one is the best for kombucha they say an oz glass has servings of fruit on the lakewood website its quite tasty in that its not too sweet very thick textured even with the tiny bits of seed in it reminiscent of a banana smoothie the ingredient list is somewhat confusing but note that only the acerola cherry is from concentrate everything else is fresh pressed acai is very high on the orac scale of antioxidants rose hips are also very high everything else is in the mid to high range of fruit pomegranate has many

5,im not sure how you review something thats as subjective as taste but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker youll like this it doesnt taste exactly like either of those but thats the closest analogy for me the sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind dipped in chocolate with one end left just normal cracker to you dont get your fingers covered in chocolate while eatingheres some of the nitty gritty details each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets that contain probably or so of the sticks the packets themselves are really cleverly designed with a little slit cut in the folded part you just grab both sides and pull and it opens up the package without any hassle gotta love japanese product design another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbingside of the stick is right at the topeach of the packets has calories from fat and about mg of sodium so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option it does contain milk wheat soybeans and sheanut so if any of these are an issue for you then youll want to pass it also says on the packaging that the facility theyre manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts the product doesnt use either of them but the disclosure is nice if youre particularly sensitive to eitheroverall a great snack at a great price the pack really is of the packets so thats quite a few snacks one note if you live in a hot climate dont order them in the summer because they will melt together in shipping duh,"['im', 'sure', 'review', 'something', 'thats', 'subjective', 'taste', 'suffice', 'say', 'like', 'chocolate', 'graham', 'cracker', 'youll', 'like', 'doesnt', 'taste', 'exactly', 'like', 'either', 'thats', 'closest', 'analogy', 'stick', 'cracker', 'kind', 'dipped', 'chocolate', 'one', 'end', 'left', 'normal', 'cracker', 'dont', 'get', 'finger', 'covered', 'chocolate', 'eatingheres', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'detail', 'box', 'contain', 'two', 'individually', 'sealed', 'packet', 'contain', 'probably', 'stick', 'packet', 'really', 'cleverly', 'designed', 'little', 'slit', 'cut', 'folded', 'part', 'grab', 'side', 'pull', 'open', 'package', 'without', 'hassle', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'japanese', 'product', 'design', 'another', 'nice', 'design', 'touch', 'open', 'properly', 'grabbingside', 'stick', 'right', 'topeach', 'packet', 'calorie', 'fat', 'mg', 'sodium', 'term', 'snack', 'pretty', 'good', 'option', 'contain', 'milk', 'wheat', 'soybean', 'sheanut', 'issue', 'youll', 'want', 'pas', 'also', 'say', 'packaging', 'facility', 'theyre', 'manufactured', 'also', 'process', 'egg', 'peanut', 'product', 'doesnt', 'use', 'either', 'disclosure', 'nice', 'youre', 'particularly', 'sensitive', 'eitheroverall', 'great', 'snack', 'great', 'price', 'pack', 'really', 'packet', 'thats', 'quite', 'snack', 'one', 'note', 'live', 'hot', 'climate', 'dont', 'order', 'summer', 'melt', 'together', 'shipping', 'duh']",im sure review something thats subjective taste suffice say like chocolate graham cracker youll like doesnt taste exactly like either thats closest analogy stick cracker kind dipped chocolate one end left normal cracker dont get finger covered chocolate eatingheres nitty gritty detail box contain two individually sealed packet contain probably stick packet really cleverly designed little slit cut folded part grab side pull open package without hassle got ta love japanese product design another nice design touch open properly grabbingside stick right topeach packet calorie fat mg sodium term snack pretty good option contain milk wheat soybean sheanut issue youll want pas also say packaging facility theyre manufactured also process egg peanut product doesnt use either disclosure nice youre particularly sensitive eitheroverall great snack great price pack really packet thats quite snack one note live hot climate dont order summer melt together shipping duh

5,i bought these back in january and never got around to reviewing them i had heard many people rave about a japanese snack called pocky so i figured i would try it out just like the description states its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate i wouldnt say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess well as long as the chocolate doesnt melt anyways in case anyone is wondering i ordered from a seller named very asia amazoncomgphelpsellerataglancehtmlieutfisamazonfulfilledorderidmarketplacesellersellerajwisei i believe it took around a weeks to actually get to me maybe it had to be imported but when it did it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever im definitely considering restocking on this in the future if i cant find a local storeedit oct inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchaseso i decided to restock after i couldnt fight the craving anymore unfortunately the batch this time was not so good ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through amazon prime what i received was not the picture shown on the front page per pack japanese pocky it was a per pack pockyish thing from thailand in my opinion the giant pack compared to smaller packs is definitely a step back packaging was fine and i ordered in october when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door the sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate the original japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouthpersonally i like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor i also have terrible self control so i buy things that come in small portions in order to a not eat everything at once and b avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items i can honestly say that i wont be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because i and my stomach dislike it so much i wont change my original rating because that still holds true for the japanese pocky but if i were to rate only the thailand pocky it would be a the taste isnt terrible but its definitely not to my liking if possible i will be uploading some pictures of what i received,"['bought', 'back', 'january', 'never', 'got', 'around',

5,pocky is just plain fun to eat i discovered these snacks at an anime convention though id heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them they are very very slim sticks of biscuity stuff the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels that have a charming tiny popping crispness the chocolate flavor a nice nonbitter nondark generically pleasing chocotaste seems to be the most popular given how fast they sell out at cons but i prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream very nicethis is by no means a health food its in the same category as a cookie its got fat and sugar and nonhealthful ingredients but hey its junk food we all know its supposed to be occasional and not habitual in the diet unless youre really prone to bingeeating or cant stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back calories with grams of fat of them saturated i wouldnt recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes in fact just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effectif you love the flavor of coconutchocolate together like almond joy try the coconut chocolate ones theyre really so good oh man hubby says the taste reminds him of the girl scout caramel delights cookies which are in turn similar to the old yes yes cookies from the seventies or soanyway if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those sticklooking treats or seen footage of cute japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats this is what they were eating fun treatshowever with this crazy hot summer id recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until falls cooler weather you might get a
