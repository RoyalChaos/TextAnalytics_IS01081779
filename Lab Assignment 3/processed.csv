mos i turn in may and the insurance goes down to mos also im single and that incurs a higher rate with my company ive got a couple other friends w awds and they pay more than i do different ins companies also so maybe im just lucky hope the info helps dan dansjdcgssmotcom motorola cellular subscriber group usa cc im live in norman oklahoma drive an thunderbird sc have never made a claim against my insurance though i have been hit several times by negligent drivers who couldnt see stop signs or were fiddling with their radios and i have had three moving violations in the last months one for going in a one for failure to clear an intersection i still say the damn light was yellow and one for going in a which didnt go on my record my rates from state farm with a passive restraint deduction on liability deductible comprehensive and deductible collision are roughly year i was paying just over year for a escort lx james james p callison microcomputer coordinator u of oklahoma law center callisonuokmaxecnuoknoredu callisonaardvarkucsuoknoredu disclaimer im not an engineer but i play one at work the forecast calls for thunder tbird sc its a hell of a thing killing a man you take away all he has and all hes ever gonna have will munny unforgiven i am beyond the under age group but i have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you i owned a toyota celica gt i decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car front runners included the toyota supra turbo and the porsche model years i narrowed it down to those two i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the but i decided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be years newer our lowerrisk division will continue to handle your account if you buy the porsche well have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double and if you go with a its another story again well cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that but the supra is much faster than the and the is actually faster than the standard that doenst make sense thats what the book says we dont insure corvettes either for some reason the underwriters consider supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough highpressure guy in the back room at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance i concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft everyones entitled to my opinion goldbergoasysdtnavymil imagination is more important than knowledge albert einstein i live in idaho when i was many years ago years i bought a trans am new insurance was about year when i turned it immediately dropped to year i had not had any accidents before or after this was strictly an age change that same rate stayed pretty much the same until i sold the car years ago my f pickup is about year less the real amazing thing is that when i woke up at age i felt so much more responsible than i was before wes for your information california male single under no moving violation alfa spider year what a bargain lets see im single male clean driving

an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy it switches to sport mode when the electronics figure it not when the driver sets the switch which is the proper way to do it imo so what does sport mode entail several things revving to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy delayed upshifts ie if you lift off briefly it will remain in the low gear this is handy if you are charging through corners and would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when theres another curve approaching part throttle downshifts based on the speed at which the pedal is depressed rather than the position of the pedal modern electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about to turn red my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough also i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick all else being equal remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at in th gear of a speed how many of people who drive manuals really know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation im sure there will be some who know but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenarioratio combinations stored in rom is likely to do better i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout high gear low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear high revs and small throttle opening the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it but not that obvious at first sight,"['excellent', 'automatic', 'found', 'subaru', 'legacy', 'switch', 'sport', 'mode', 'electronics', 'figure', 'driver', 'set', 'switch', 'proper', 'way', 'imo', 'sport', 'mode', 'entail', 'several', 'thing', 'revving', 'red', 'line', 'rev', 'limiter', 'case', 'legacy', 'delayed', 'upshifts', 'ie', 'lift', 'briefly', 'remain', 'low', 'gear', 'handy', 'charging', 'corner', 'would', 'like', 'without', 'distraction', 'upshifts', 'there', 'another', 'curve', 'approaching', 'part', 'throttle', 'downshift', 'based', 'speed', 'pedal', 'depressed', 'rather', 'position', 'pedal', 'modern', 'electronics', 'measure', 'easily', 'switch', 'sport', 'mode', 'wonderful', 'want', 'charge', 'green', 'light', 'turn', 'red', 'audi', 'sens', 'well', 'downshift', 'little', 'half', 'throttle', 'right', 'foot', 'fast', 'enough', 'also', 'think', 'smart', 'automatic', 'deliver', 'better', 'gas', 'mileage', 'dumb', 'driver', 'stick', 'else', 'equal', 'remember', 'idea', 'stick', 'economical', 'automatic', 'make', 'big', 'assumption', 'driver', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'gear', 'use', 'situation', 'many', 'time', 'ridden', 'inattentive', 'driver', 'cruising', 'highway', 'th', 'gear', 'speed', 'many', 'people', 'drive', 'manual', 'really', 'know', 'best', 'gear', 'use', 'every', 'conceivable', 'situation', 'im', 'sure', 'know', 'suspect', 'chip', 'controlled', 'automatic', 'possible', 'scenarioratio', 'combination', 'stored', 'rom', 'likely', 'better', 'also', 'say', 'previous', 'assumption', 'proved', 'wrong', 'got', 'car', 'instantaneous', 'mpg', 'readout', 'high', 'gear', 'low', 'rev', 'wide', 'open', 'throttle', 'economical', 'low', 'gear', 'high', 'rev', 'small', 'throttle', 'opening', 'explanation', 'quite', 'simple', 'one', 'sits', 'think', 'obvious', 'first', 'sight']",excellent automatic found subaru legacy switch sport mode electronics figure driver set switch proper way imo sport mode entail several thing revving red line rev limiter case legacy delayed upshifts ie lift briefly remain low gear handy charging corner would like without distraction upshifts there another curve approaching part throttle downshift based speed pedal depressed rather position pedal modern electronics measure easily switch sport mode wonderful want charge green light turn red audi sens well downshift little half throttle right foot fast enough also think smart automatic deliver better gas mileage dumb driver stick else equal remember idea stick economical automatic make big assumption driver smart enough know gear use situation many time ridden inattentive driver cruising highway th gear speed many people drive manual really know best gear use every conceivable situation im sure know suspect chip controlled automatic possible scenarioratio combination stored rom likely better also say previous assumption proved wrong got car instantaneous mpg readout high gear low rev wide open throttle economical low gear high rev small throttle opening explanation quite simple one sits think obvious first sight

stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed deleted the mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the sho its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock mustang because of the suspension yes when i think mustang i think schoolbus f motor in my mind the mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at or so it just isnt safe check out your local junkyard mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards i find it astonishing the cu or somesuchlike has not jumped on the mustang for poor brakes in relation to power ford should at least standardize on the svo rear brakes for all s true of northern europe latin countries are something else kindof true remember they were build by adolf in the s yes autobahn is the german word for

western europe are much higher than the us law enforcement is negligible in my experience comapred to the us as there is no revenue enhancement motivation the things you really notice are the higher speed differentials and the more professional attitude to driving you just never see two cars running parallel at mph oblivious to all around them youre wrong gtis go this fast just kind of noisy not the ideal autobahn car a lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor how do i know when youre not making any ground on the identical car in front of you if something

this happened about a year ago on the washington dc beltway snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass four or five cars were hit there were several serious injuries and sadly a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck in the head by one of the larger rocks i dont recall if she made it but i think she was comatose for a month or so and doctors werent holding out hope that shed live what the hell is happening to this great country of ours i can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but pound rocks has our society really stooped this low yes nobody is watching them if they get caught there is no punishment at all in the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping with a goodsized belt and then taken into some hospital to see first hand what kind of damage such accidents cause of course this doesnt happen any more that whipping would probably save the kids life by teaching him some respect for others a person with that little respect would inevitably wind up dead early anyway the problem is creeping gradualism if you put a frog into hot water he just jumps out but if you put him into cold water and then everso gradually heat it the frog will cook this is what the entertainment industry and lack of religious moral and educational standards in our modern north american society have done to us over the years now that we are about to be cooked we may have woken up too late erik velapold society as we have known it it coming apart at the seams the basic reason is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is no big deal kids see hundreds on murderous acts on tv we can abort children on demand and kill the sick and old at will so why be surprised when some kids drop lbs rocks and kill people they dont care because the message they hear is life is cheap and the education system and the religious leaders arent doing much about it either with both parents working in this society where is the stabilizing influence at home latchkey children are everywhere and these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to whatever violent hatepromoting music and videos they like because no one is home to stop it this day and age when there is about times more things to learn than when i went to school our answer to this increased knowledge is shorter school hours and more leisure time i say keep the kids in school longer feed them good food and teach them something and when they get home have a parent there to interact and monitor them there is a very old and now forgotten proverb a child left on his own will bring a parent to grief daycare systems are not the answer this is just shifting the parents own responsibilities off on someone else to whom its not a lifelong committment but rather just a job at followups should go to altparentsteens fred w bach operations group internet

you can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop doesnt see it right awayvalentine is the best detector by far as stated by car and driver and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from it also gives the amount of threats it is picking up so if you go through the same place everyday and it always goes off there you can glance at the number of threats the valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop its about and you can only get it factory directone problem rob fusi rwflehighedu,"['also', 'put', 'detector', 'side', 'dash', 'cop', 'doesnt', 'see', 'right', 'awayvalentine', 'best', 'detector', 'far', 'stated', 'car', 'driver', 'even', 'tell', 'direction', 'radar', 'coming', 'also', 'give', 'amount', 'threat', 'picking', 'go', 'place', 'everyday', 'always', 'go', 'glance', 'number', 'threat', 'valentine', 'detecting', 'see', 'genuine', 'cop', 'get', 'factory', 'directone', 'problem', 'rob', 'fusi', 'rwflehighedu']",also put detector side dash cop doesnt see right awayvalentine best detector far stated car driver even tell direction radar coming also give amount threat picking go place everyday always go glance number threat valentine detecting see genuine cop get factory directone problem rob fusi rwflehighedu

archivename recautospart most recent changes march addition of altautoskarting rpw welcome to recautos this article is sent out automatically each month and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups and some suggested guidelines for discussions the keywords monthly posting will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities this article is posted to all autos groups but followups are directed only to recautos if you dont understand what this means ask your system administrator for help or at least for copies of the newuser documentation failing that please subscribe to the newsgroup newsannouncenewusers and read the documentation provided there introduction to the recautos newsgroup hierarchy recautostech is intended for technical discussions of automobiles their design construction diagnosis and service other discussions are largely inappropriate especially for sale ads recautossport is intended for discussion of legal organized competition involving automobiles technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles discussion from either of two viewpoints spectator and participant is encouraged arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate as are most other discussions for sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles andor equipment discussions of illegal events are marginal one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law remember the fbi reads usenet recautosdriving is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles also if you must discuss vs or radar detectors or insert your pet driving peeve boneheads do it here recautosvw is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by volkswagen this includes vws audis seats etc it was created on the grounds that the infovw mailing list was very successful it should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest via some avenue such as a mailing list recaudiocar is not properly part of the recautos hierarchy it is however the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and so is mentioned here recautosantique is intended for the discussion of older cars usually more than years old although this is not a hardandfast rule althotrod is not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the recautos reader it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles altautosrodncustom also not part of the official hierarchy devoted to that peculiar american hobby of customizing older cars altautoskarting for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting recautos is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics crossposting crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the newsgroups line in the article header such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on usenet you should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience this distinction is subtle but important radar detector articles for example are moreorless appropriate in recautos they are almost never appropriate in scielectronics or rechamradio and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in scielectronics or rechamradio is not adequate justification for posting to either group crossposting between any or all of the recautos groups is usually inappropriate if you find yourself doing so consider whether or not it is truly advisable before sending your article consider setting followupto to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost crossposting between recautos and miscconsumers is chancy at best in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the us andor the use of radar detectors should never be crossposted between any of these groups most readers of scielectronics and recradio couldnt care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in recautos it is an excellent idea to check the newsgroups and followupto lines of articles before posting a followup in particular be wary of posting to misctest recartsstartrek or talkbizarre or any combination of these three the life you save may be your own distribution there is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to partially control where the article goes it is called the distribution field it may be very useful for many reasons it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system the distribution of recautos is fairly extensive as of this writing the automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of europe australia new zealand and some locations in japan with this in mind i offer the following hints about use of the distribution field in your article headers and on article content please take care not to send forsale ads about clapped out ford mavericks in new jersey to france or california i doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason likes mavericks but only door mavericks at that when posting technical questions please include the market for which your car was manufactured for example there are a number of differences between a europeanmarket ford escort and a usmarket escort likewise all cc and early cc alfa romeos reached the us with spica fuel injection european market cars usually got carbs often webers these differences can be important to your readers make your situation clear failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting in the us we get a mix of metric and english system values whereas europe is almost entirely on the metric system a future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonlyused abbreviations that may not be known in some places that recautos reaches this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it use the distribution field to limit where your article goes when possible within north america the values na north america can canada and usa may be used in addition the twoletter state abbreviations of the us are supported in some cases eg if i wanted to send an article only to new york and new jersey i could put nynj in a distribution field note that multiple commaseparated values are legal these distribution fields vary widely however so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area the dangers of overgeneralization to amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars tires etc what is true for a buick with a cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a honda with a cc engine headlight laws in sweden are decidedly different from those in idaho the need for adequate specification when you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information eg if you have a question about your honda please specify year model engine size etc otherwise most answers to your question may be quite useless concerning lemons at one time or another every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two even honda admits to this please dont waste everyones time by announcing to the world that your brand x automobile is terrible so all brand x automobiles are terrible so no one should ever buy a car from the brand x company such articles are worse than useless because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information concerning flames as much as we might wish it a flamefree newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them a list of flameprone topics follows in the next section of this posting if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory dont imagine for a minute that including the words no flames will work it wont and youll get exactly what you deserve if youre going to flame youre more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a wellknown reference no one is likely to believe bald unsupported assertions be careful about who you choose to insult consider not insulting anyone asking the question it is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like please send email i dont read this group it is a much better idea to end the question with please send email if there is sufficient interest ill summarize the results in a later posting i may miss posted responses to this request answering the question if someone wants to hop up their yugo dont tell them to get a mustang either be silent or give them useful advice if someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket dont tell them to obey the law next time its offensive presumes guilt which is not proven and doesnt directly address the original question in general dont post in order to see your words in print and dont post in order to enjoy feeling smug and selfrighteous stale andor inflammatory topics certain topics are considered stale by old timers while discussion of them is certainly ok and new factual information is welcome ravings about them are extremely tiresome and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether some topics are naturally inflammatory it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them some of these topics include the following the mph speed limit in the us pro and con discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar detectors discussions over which radar detector is best discussions over what is a sports car this is one reason why recautossport is not a sports car group everyone would argue about what constitutes a sports car disputes over whether or not us federal law protects the drivers right to own and operate a radar detector buy american discussions clever bumper stickers and personalized license plates cars are terrible what kind of car did maxwell smart drive when i have a complete accurate answer it will be added to the commonlyasked questions article which is also posted monthly

howdy im a little new to this newsgroup but i would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here the subject aftermarket cruise controls the background i recently broke my ankle in a roadbicycling accident places five screws yuk in two weeks i will be returning to texas my home from my school byu in provo utah as you can imagine trying to drive nearly miles with a broken right ankle isnt just the epitome of a good time my car does not have a cruise control so i would have to do all the pedalling ha ha with my messedup ankle my question what is the general opinion of aftermarket cruise control units i realize that a cheap cc cruise control from say pep boys isnt going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit if there is such a thing and i uderstand that i probably cant expect much in the way of accuracy looks and that sort of thing but anythings gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle i have a jeep cherokee speed standard l engine with ketteringsp ignition yknow distributor cap rotor that setupnot electronic maybe you couldve guessed it being an but im just trying to give information as completly as i can i found a cc unit for bucks it seems to use the vehicles vacuum system instead of an electric servormotor is this good or bad if i did buy this cc which vacuum hose should i tap it has two speed sensors one magnetic and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the distributor kinda like a tach pickup or so i understand i can use either one which is best the manual says i read it in the store today that the magneticaxle setup is more accurate but harder to install is there really a big difference it has a sensor for the brake pedal just like other ccs but does not have a sensor for the clutch pedal so if i wasnt paying real close attention i might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up which would wind the engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me and turned the thing off im pretty coordinated so this doesnt bother me if it were for my girlfriends car then it would bother me but im ok with it the installation also calls for an attachment to a steadyon brake signal and a switchedon brake signal i think i can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse am i right but im not sure where to get the steadyon brake signal or for that matter what exactly it is any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it i think i can figure the other things out like how to hookup the negative side tachtype sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit and the ground and all that miscellaneous business but i need a little help with is it worth the money and safety risk if any for such a device is there any particularly good aftermarket cc are professionally installed ccs signifacantly better and worth the cabbage if the unit i saw sorry no manufacturer or model number just that it is at pep boy and its is sufficient for my simple needs how do i get the thing installed properly specifically the questions above my father and i built a veep volkswagen powered jeep cja when i was in high school so i consider myself fairly good with tools electronics and cars so the installation doesnt scare me i just want to be certain that i get the thing installed correctly as my cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my veep i appreciate your time in reading my post and i would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject if you would like to share some of your wisdom please email as i dont get over this group very often but i check my mail all the time again thanks for any help anyone may have,"['howdy', 'im', 'little', 'new', 'newsgroup', 'would', 'like',

nnnnnnnng thank you for playing i cannot agree with this i believed this and to put it nicely it was a piece of junk i loved this car i babied it i pampered it and after years it just couldnt stay together i would say that not everyone will have the problems that i had but know this its not just the car it is the ability to get the car fixed which will not happen at any chryslerdodgetake your pick dealer i dont care if there are going to reform their dealersservice with the intro of the lh cars i will believe it when i see it case and point the local dodge dealer you drive up just looking you dont even get out of your door when about yes salesman all eye you like their next meal and literally pounce on you and try to get you to make a deal on everything your eye wanders towards service is about times worse than that i had an alignment problem but they tried to tell me that the k frame was bent and about dollars of workparts to fix it let me tell you the problems i had and i took care of this car i put alot of miles on it in the first couple years but took it to every checkup it needed and many that shouldnt have been dodge shadow es these were replaced within the years that i owned the car engine alternators rear suspension torsion bar water pumps thermostats hall effect sensor main computer batteries these were rebuiltrepaired radiator automatic transmission power steering those are just the things i can remember off the top of my head for about a year before i sold the car i said to myself its a good car i just cant find anybody competent enough the fix it in the end before i traded it in for a saturn the power steering started acting up again i just stopped putting money into it i must have put at least worth of repairs over its lifetime i am sorry but lee iacocca can bite me bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why the hell do you think that lh has been nicknamed last hope you can do better and i know people will disagree with me here but japanese like honda or toyota or the only american car company that i feel is a quality product saturn i will not touch another chrysler product again no way i dont care how good the lh cars look good and i will admit they look promising but not with the support that you get gm isnt much better thank god they dont control saturn like they do their divisions or it would be just another marketing ploy dont get me wrong i will be watching my car which i do like like a hawk for the next years i am much more hesitant to say it or any car is really good until it has proved itself to me but since someone else pointed out cd as a source i will note because i used to read these magazines that car and driver has never had a good thing to say about most chrysler products shadow for one always were they moaning about the reguritated kcar and engine whereas motor trend always thought they were great cars no car magazine is really objective and although there are alot of people who dont like consumers reports i will use them to reinforce my argument i already know about the big stink with the saturn crash tests time will tell how good a car they are the shadowsundance rate much worse than average in fact none of the chryslers rate a better than average i think the best one is just average excluding the diamond starmitsubishi stuff and the lhs you can find bad stuff about the shadow try as i might when i researched the saturn i could not find anything bad about it there is a great deal of information about this company just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community for good reason much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company i read an article which had a subcolumn an i think this imprinted on me more than anything else some big wig in toyota said and i quote we are watching them very closely come on everybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have been kicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days to set in their ways which is one of the reasons saturn was created they are still struggling because they havent learned yet they have the ability the workers are not inferior the technology is not out of date but their attitude is and they are just finding this out its called competition gentlemanwomen if you dont satisfy the demand of the consumer well your out asbestos suit

long silly discussion deleted this suggestion isnt as farfetched as it sounds years ago in another time and place i used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines in many cases there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each side and if you did get something there youd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again so we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick hole there was a longthin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube and another thickershorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient container im sure these gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one,"['long', 'silly', 'discussion', 'deleted', 'suggestion', 'isnt', 'farfetched', 'sound', 'year', 'ago', 'another', 'time', 'place', 'used', 'oil', 'change', 'boat', 'powered', 'automotive', 'engine', 'many', 'case', 'way', 'get', 'sort', 'tray', 'oil', 'pan', 'boxed', 'bottom', 'hull', 'various', 'floation', 'chamber', 'side', 'get', 'something', 'youd', 'spill', 'oil', 'sure', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'used', 'small', 'pump', 'powered', 'electric', 'drill', 'suck', 'oil', 'dipstick', 'hole', 'longthin', 'hose', 'inlet', 'side', 'designed', 'fit', 'dipstick', 'tube', 'another', 'thickershorter', 'hose', 'outlet', 'side', 'put', 'convenient', 'container', 'im', 'sure', 'gadget', 'still', 'available', 'marine', 'hardware', 'supplier', 'want', 'one']",long silly discussion deleted suggestion isnt farfetched sound year ago another time place used oil change boat powered automotive engine many case way get sort tray oil pan boxed bottom hull various floation chamber side get something youd spill oil sure trying get back used small pump powered electric drill suck oil dipstick hole longthin hose inlet side designed fit dipstick tube another thickershorter hose outlet side put convenient container im sure gadget still available marine hardware supplier want one

some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented about this problem but i havent seen it happen on my month old probe gt i think this may be something that ford has corrected since the initial batch of cars also someone said that ford has issued a service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you may be able to get your dealer to fix it havent seen any of these problems nor have i seen these mentioned on the mailing list so these might just be having bad luck with these definitely no problems like these either i havent been able to find any obvious places where they screwed up hmmm i got two keys with my car something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this actually if you count the credit card key that came in the owners binder i got keys but since the credit card key doesnt have any teeth cut in it yet i guess i wont count it the latter is probably because of the air bag its pretty much takes up all the space where youd expect to find the horn speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes i agree strongly with all of the above especially about the engine the interior is very very nice too very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound yes this cars stiff suspension isnt for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car id strongly suggest looking into the mx the problem with the back seat is that theres no leg room plenty of head room though shorter people fit back there without any complaints so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to give them a place to put their feet the power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car i really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then ive always been a sucker for open air driving no leakage problems or anything like thatyet i havent heard about this one i know that some of the very early probes and maybe had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which ford will replace at no charge but i havent heard about anything like this concerning the probes i havent had any real trouble with this car outside of a cv joint boot that was leaking but the dealer took care of that promptly and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car i was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering that i was expecting the worst from them from what ive heard it sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably mx when they first went into production but i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point thats almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though hope this helps chuck,"['owner', 'fordprobeworldstdcom', 'mailing', 'list', 'commented',

i just visited the ny auto show and saw two lh cars on the floor eagle vision and dodge intrepid really nice i must say very attractive styling lots of features and room at a competitive price unfortunately the workmanship is quite disappointing on both cars the rubber seals around the window and door fell off it turns out the seals are just big grooved rubber band it goes on just by pressing the groove against the tongue on the door frame surely it would come off easily i am not sure how many of this kind of pooring engineeringassembly problems that will show up later i may still consider buying it but only when it establishes a good track record,"['visited', 'ny', 'auto', 'show', 'saw', 'two', 'lh', 'car', 'floor', 'eagle', 'vision', 'dodge', 'intrepid', 'really', 'nice', 'must', 'say', 'attractive', 'styling', 'lot', 'feature', 'room', 'competitive', 'price', 'unfortunately', 'workmanship', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'car', 'rubber', 'seal', 'around', 'window', 'door', 'fell', 'turn', 'seal', 'big', 'grooved', 'rubber', 'band', 'go', 'pressing', 'groove', 'tongue', 'door', 'frame', 'surely', 'would', 'come', 'easily', 'sure', 'many', 'kind', 'pooring', 'engineeringassembly', 'problem', 'show', 'later', 'may', 'still', 'consider', 'buying', 'establishes', 'good', 'track', 'record']",visited ny auto show saw two lh car floor eagle vision dodge intrepid really nice must say attractive styling lot feature room competitive price unfortunately workmanship quite disappointing car rubber seal around window door fell turn seal big grooved rubber band go pressing groove tongue door frame surely would come easily sure many kind pooring engineeringassembly problem show later may still consider buying establishes good track record
i think vw got caught out on the airbag thing its only been in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature vw assumed that automatic belts would satisfy govt requirements for passive restraint but didnt guess that the merican consumer would actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag vw is really hurting right now in the us market check out the article in last weeks autoweek about the crisis at vw golfs and jettas will be coming from the plant in mexico but they dont have the quality at that facility as per normal vw practice the us launch of the jetta iii is delayed again and again until a good chunk of the useful life of the design is spent i think that passats come from germany so there is not the same quality and availability issue its a nice car with a nice engine whether vw will be a player in the us market in two years time is a different question,"['think', 'vw', 'got', 'caught', 'airbag', 'thing', 'last', 'year', 'two', 'airbags', 'become', 'significant', 'selling', 'feature', 'vw', 'assumed', 'automatic', 'belt', 'would', 'satisfy', 'govt', 'requirement', 'passive', 'restraint', 'didnt', 'guess', 'merican', 'consumer', 'would', 'actually', 'make', 'buy', 'decision', 'based', 'presence', 'airbag', 'vw', 'really', 'hurting', 'right', 'u', 'market', 'check', 'article', 'last', 'week', 'autoweek', 'crisis', 'vw', 'golf', 'jettas', 'coming', 'plant', 'mexico', 'dont', 'quality', 'facility', 'per', 'normal', 'vw', 'practice', 'u', 'launch', 'jetta', 'iii', 'delayed', 'good', 'chunk', 'useful', 'life', 'design', 'spent', 'think', 'passats', 'come', 'germany', 'quality', 'availability', 'issue', 'nice', 'car', 'nice', 'engine', 'whether', 'vw', 'player', 'u', 'market', 'two', 'year', 'time', 'different', 'question']",think vw got caught airbag thing last year two airbags become significant selling feature vw assumed automatic belt would satisfy govt requirement passive restraint didnt guess merican consumer would actually make buy decision based presence airbag vw really hurting right u market check article last week autoweek crisis vw golf jettas coming plant mexico dont quality facility per normal vw practice u launch jetta iii delayed good chunk useful life design spent think passats come germany quality availability issue nice car nice engine whether vw player u market two year time different question
while i dont read normally read this group i was looking for valentine radar information sigh maybe in the faq and came across your posting i bought a probe gt with the pep a last july now at miles after debating over the sentra sernx mx mr stealth prelude and celica check this months consumer reports for previous probe records my criteria a fun car with abs airbag over hp and less than k i thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out the tristar cars eclipsetalonetc were out since they dont have an air bag ditto for the mustangalso no abs the sernxm fell into the pocketrocket category a good used car buy the mx was almost there but rolled more than i liked i didnt like the prelude dashinstrumentation at all too weird for me the mr has a much smaller nonpassenger space than i needed so out that went the celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat overpriced too in nonturbo form i never considered the sx since it didnt have an airbag i did look at it for its rwd virtues but thats it the corolla never entered my mind i should have looked at the mitsubishi vrdodge stealth more since my list was exhausted i bought the probe the car design is different than earlier years so its too early to see its reliability so far for what its worth my comments my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal headlights have stuck up a few times weather air conditioning broke miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not stitched properly hopefully just a fluke ford only gives key with the car cmon ford spend an extra few pennies rear hatch has no padding on corners when up im waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference tires fling dirtmud onto side of car my likes engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque definitely handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits transmission the speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the sho i drive stability at mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather absair bag see above rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still tires vr goodyear eagles left hoping for k as you can see im primarily interested in the engine while it doesnt have the uummmph of a bigliter car or the turbo rush the big selling point for me was the allaluminum value liter engine the overall car is a good buy for the money that market segment hasnt changed much since july prelude vtec honda del sol i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probes suspension doesnt like potholes when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable if you have passengers by all means bring them along too theyll find that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides differently if thats better is up to you also theres a lot of glass around you which i wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine leather and the keyless entry system werent available when i got the car so i cant comment on them i got the car before it was officially announced i prefer cloth to leather anyway i wouldnt want this car in the snow the suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes tires arent meant for snow and the seats assume that youre not wearing lots of thick clothing rain is much better water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable and i barely hydroplaned once with the eagles and i was really trying there is also a definite lack of cup holdersmall storage places the gt has map holders below the speakers in the door but theyre rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or cds max the center consolestorage binarm rest has cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch but thats it no change holders quite a letdown from the sho and the probe is definitely not a peoplemover car or an econobox car lastly dont store wet car covers in the back the foam will soak the water up and the result will not smell pleasant

the part about spending on repairs reminds me of an article i read in a magazine comparing the year ownership costs of a toyota camry and a ford taurus or something like that the result which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period that was their argument to prove that you dont go wrong buying the ford taurus over the camry now if i remember correctly the camry costs about or so more in initial costs essentially it means that you spend about extra on repairs on the taurus that is ridiculous every time your car needs repairs it is extra hassles loss of time and a dozen other things i would much rather spend more in initial costs than spend more in repair costs,"['part', 'spending', 'repair', 'reminds', 'article', 'read', 'magazine', 'comparing', 'year', 'ownership', 'cost', 'toyota', 'camry', 'ford', 'taurus', 'something', 'like', 'result', 'announced', 'great', 'flourish', 'cost', 'end', 'period', 'argument', 'prove', 'dont', 'go', 'wrong', 'buying', 'ford', 'taurus', 'camry', 'remember', 'correctly', 'camry', 'cost', 'initial', 'cost', 'essentially', 'mean', 'spend', 'extra', 'repair', 'taurus', 'ridiculous', 'every', 'time', 'car', 'need', 'repair', 'extra', 'hassle', 'loss', 'time', 'dozen', 'thing', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'spend', 'initial', 'cost', 'spend', 'repair', 'cost']",part spending repair reminds article read magazine comparing year ownership cost toyota camry ford taurus something like result announced great flourish cost end period argument prove dont go wrong buying ford taurus camry remember correctly camry cost initial cost essentially mean spend extra repair taurus ridiculous every time car need repair extra hassle loss time dozen thing would much rather spend initial cost spend repair cost

archivename recautospart this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions of general consumer interest and is broken out to facilitate crossposting to miscconsumers rpw last change february ct now permits radar detector usage new tiretraction qa rpw commonly asked questions radar questions q where are radar detectors illegal a in the us currently virgina and the district of columbia prohibit all usage of radar detectors new york prohibits their use in large trucks in canada they are illegal in manitoba ontario quebec newfoundland and pei prince edward island they are apparently are illegal through most if not all of europe legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other jurisdictions chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal q where are radar detector detectors used do they really work a usage is spreading rapidly initially they were used only in canada but now they are appearing in new york and virginia it is unsafe to assume that they are not in use in connecticut and dc they work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently available super het radar detectors some brands of detector radiate more strongly than others and are thus more likely to be spotted new radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected by the current generation of detector detectors note that a detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned on q what is vascar is it some kind of radar a vascar is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and timespeeddistance computer it depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target vehicle passes landmarks no radar signals are emitted by a vascar system q what is ka band radar where is it used should a radar detector be able to handle it a ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us in socalled photoradar installations in these installations a lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a degree angle to the direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle because of the low power and the degree angle many people believe that a radar detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway the number of locales where photoradar is in use is limited and some question the legality of such units best advice learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they are used or else dont speed q do radar jammers work are they legal a quick answer no and not in the usa detailed answer cheap radar jammers do not work well at all jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the military jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the federal communications commission of the usa driving technique and vehicle dynamics questions q what are understeer and oversteer a understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a car while cornering near the limit limit of adhesion that is most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to be descriptive of the situations they encounter simply put they tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner steer less or understeer or it wants to turn more in a corner oversteer understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast wont get into trouble understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle in a corner oversteer is designed into some more performance oriented cars it may be induced by lifting on the throttle trailing throttle oversteer or tto in extreme cases lifting on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or spinning some technical details in a corner at speed the tires on the car will develop what are called slip angles the slip angle is the angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to travel in understeer the front wheels have a greater slip angle than the rear wheels in oversteer the rear wheels have a greater slip angle than the front wheels q what is a revmatched downshift a when downshifting the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear than it was in the higher gear however during a downshift normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the revs drop rather than increase in revmatched downshift you blip the throttle before reengaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed this results in a much smoother and faster downshift q what does heelandtoe mean a heelandtoe is a technique used to do a revmatched downshift while braking this is normally challenging because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle it is called heelandtoe because you use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift in many modern cars this is a misnomer often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplishing the same thing q what is doubleclutch downshifting a while your right foot is doing the above your left foot can do one of three things nothing declutch once or declutch twice the reason for declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the transmission to the speed of the engine this is usually coupled with revmatching so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch engaged the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission speed up the procedure is as follows declutch move gearshift lever to neutral engage clutch match revs declutch move gearshift lever to next lower gear engage clutch this sounds like a lot of work but with practice it becomes natural the problem that doubleclutching solves is normally the function of the synchronizers within the gearbox in transmissions without synchros or with very worn synchros doubleclutching makes it much easier to shift basically if you doubleclutch well you are not using the synchros at all this is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good condition q what do the numbers for acceleration from mile skidpad and slalom times in the auto magazines really mean may they be compared a in short not as much as the magazines want you to believe and almost never in more detail the acceleration numbers mph and mile times in the us may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the same source testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine that comparing a road track number to a car driver number is quite pointless keep in mind too that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street the driver is a major often the major part of the equation skidpads vary and even if they didnt skidpad figures are really only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires they change radically when tire compounds change do not make any assumptions about the comparative handling of say two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers this is not to suggest that skidpads are without value however skidpads are an excellent educational tool at driving schools they are simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires slalom times are slightly more useful they test some small parts of the automobiles transient response however they are also heavily influenced by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corners of the cars envelope they do not tell you all you need to know before making a buying decision for example they dont tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes offcamber when a car has an adjustable suspension these tests are usually done in the sport setting which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving the list of caveats could go on for page after page q my buddy claims that wide tires dont make any difference according to his freshman physics textbook and that you cant ever accelerate or corner at more than g does he know what hes talking about a in short he hasnt got a clue in more detail the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth dry and nondeformable none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating temperature pavement is never smooth it is always irregular to a greater or lesser extent tires which are not really dry and solid as rubber is a substance which in its natural form is liquid and which has only been coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over in a tire at operating temperature grip is actually generated by shear stresses inside the deformed rubber and not by anything even remotely resembling friction in the freshman physics sense of the term the colder a tire is relative to its operating temperature the closer its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the its proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually reverting to liquid which is mostly like to happen deep in the tread causing characteristic blisters and chunking this latter though is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving so unless youre a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track driving dont worry about it because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all thus dragsters accelerate at more than g and race cars corner and brake at more than g because simple friction does not apply it is actually possible for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of grip an actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques such as finite element analysis due to the complexity of the mechanism misc questions q what does stand for a here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked about be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names as misinformation abounds on the net in particular never ask in rechumor if you want a useful result saab svenska aeroplan a b or the swedish airplane corporation alfa societa anonima lombarda fabbrica automobili or the lombardy automobile manufacturing company fiat fabbrica italiana di automobili torino or the italian automobile manufacturers of turin bmw bayerische motoren werke or bavarian motor works mg morris garage q does vw own porsche a no porsche is a publicly held company controlled by the porsche and piech families porsche has extensive business dealings with vwaudi which causes some confusion since currently porsche is in some financial difficulty there is a possibility that mercedes or vw may be interested in

im wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter ive been doing it my self over miles on my current toyota truck ive got over k ive heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission my experiences suggest otherwise what techniques do you use on some old pieces of junk i drove the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift except clutchless to date ive driven rabbits datsuns comets fords a chevy some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker easier they where to shift my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever if for some reason i miss the shift window i lightly press the accelerator try agian ive found that clutchless shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms i also skip gears some times using,"['im', 'wondering', 'anybody', 'else', 'clutchless', 'shifter', 'ive', 'self', 'mile', 'current', 'toyota', 'truck', 'ive', 'got', 'k', 'ive', 'heard', 'people', 'talk', 'damage', 'transmission', 'experience', 'suggest', 'otherwise', 'technique', 'use', 'old', 'piece', 'junk', 'drove', 'transmission', 'worn', 'pumping', 'clutch', 'way', 'shift', 'except', 'clutchless', 'date', 'ive', 'driven', 'rabbit', 'datsuns', 'comet', 'ford', 'chevy', 'harder', 'others', 'shift', 'generally', 'higher', 'milage', 'smoother', 'quicker', 'easier', 'shift', 'technique', 'ease', 'back', 'throttle', 'time', 'gently', 'wrist', 'back', 'shift', 'lever', 'reason', 'miss', 'shift', 'window', 'lightly', 'press', 'accelerator', 'try', 'agian', 'ive', 'found', 'clutchless', 'shifting', 'eaiserquicker', 'high', 'rpm', 'also', 'skip', 'gear', 'time', 'using']",im wondering anybody else clutchless shifter ive self mile current toyota truck ive got k ive heard people talk damage transmission experience suggest otherwise technique use old piece junk drove transmission worn pumping clutch way shift except clutchless date ive driven rabbit datsuns comet ford chevy harder others shift generally higher milage smoother quicker easier shift technique ease back throttle time gently wrist back shift lever reason miss shift window lightly press accelerator try agian ive found clutchless shifting eaiserquicker high rpm also skip gear time using

while not exactly a service incident i had a similar experience recently when i bought a new truck i had picked out the vehicle i wanted and after a little haggling we agreed on a price i wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them id be back that evening to pick up the truck when i returned i had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could get to me when i finally got in there everything went smoothly until he started adding up the numbers he then discovered that they had miscalculated the tax license by about he then said he needed another from me i said we had already agreed on a price and it was their problem i wasnt giving them any more money the finance guy then a similar thing happend to me a year ago i bought a used ford bronco which has since been stolen and few weeks after i paid and took delivery they sent a letter telling me they goofed and miscalculated the license renewal by and that i need to send in a check to avoid further delay in the processing of my registration the thing is i had already received the pink slip from the dmv so i ignored it i received another letter and then the phone calls started coming first from the finance guy and then from the general manager both hounding me for the extra money they left me alone once i told them i already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause in the contract that stated that the final price was just that final afterall they wouldnt budge if i had told them i wanted another off after the deal had been signed right i told them not to call again and that i would not do business with them in the future they didnt seem to have a problem with that this after all was a used ford at a toyota dealership i had a much better experience buying a new pathfinder about a month ago it certainly pays to buy a car on the last sunday of the month it was even raining too so they had done very little business that weekend and were really willing to deal i kept telling them i would think about it and they kept dropping the price got a very good deal and so far have been very please with the service,"['exactly', 'service', 'incident', 'similar', 'experience', 'recently',

perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all testified that the batf shot first they they did not identify themselves before tossing in concussion grenades not that anyone inside could have heard such identification after being near a concussion grenade and the announcement from the batf that they have sealed the warrant under which they were operating which was a search warrant by the way not an arrest warrant in short perhaps because the batf is wildly out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a compound full of woman and children will not improve their position there is a real chance that koresh will be able to prove selfdefense in court that will leave what four officers dead and no one to blame but the batf followups directed to altactivism where the discussion has raged nearly as long as the seige and which shows every sign of not giving up nearly as soon larry smith smithctroncom no i dont speak for cabletron need you ask,"['perhaps', 'witness', 'left', 'compound', 'testified', 'batf', 'shot', 'first', 'identify', 'tossing', 'concussion', 'grenade', 'anyone', 'inside', 'could', 'heard', 'identification', 'near', 'concussion', 'grenade', 'announcement', 'batf', 'sealed', 'warrant', 'operating', 'search', 'warrant', 'way', 'arrest', 'warrant', 'short', 'perhaps', 'batf', 'wildly', 'control', 'perhaps', 'calmer', 'head', 'realized', 'bombing', 'compound', 'full', 'woman', 'child', 'improve', 'position', 'real', 'chance', 'koresh', 'able', 'prove', 'selfdefense', 'court', 'leave', 'four', 'officer', 'dead', 'one', 'blame', 'batf', 'followup', 'directed', 'altactivism', 'discussion', 'raged', 'nearly', 'long', 'seige', 'show', 'every', 'sign', 'giving', 'nearly', 'soon', 'larry', 'smith', 'smithctroncom', 'dont', 'speak', 'cabletron', 'need', 'ask']",perhaps witness left compound testified batf shot first identify tossing concussion grenade anyone inside could heard identification near concussion grenade announcement batf sealed warrant operating search warrant way arrest warrant short perhaps batf wildly control perhaps calmer head realized bombing compound full woman child improve position real chance koresh able prove selfdefense court leave four officer dead one blame batf followup directed altactivism discussion raged nearly long seige show every sign giving nearly soon larry smith smithctroncom dont speak cabletron need ask

around even a door tercel will cost less than a door paseo now you might be saying that the tercel doesnt offer the power that some doors offer what i mean is that there is no dr tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative lets take another example the isuzu stylus xs and impulse xsstorm gsi both have the same powerplants a l hp engine but the smaller dr coupes are generally more expensive again this is because the twodoor sport coupe market is a more fashionoriented and trendsetting segment people are willing to pay more money for this type of car in short even

yes but the point is that prices are competetive saturn may well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a profit but since a comperable honda with profit is more expensive it may be well worth it to buy the saturn not necessarily it seems to me that saturn salesdroids who dont make a commision whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally do make more per hour or whatever this means that saturn doesnt give up the profit to their employees through commision which is taken out of per car profits they just pass it along to less pressureing salesmenwomen maybe maybe not depends on accounting practices id rather pay more for dealer service that doesnt cut corners to contain costs cka carolina blue honda civic dx,"['yes', 'point', 'price', 'competetive', 'saturn', 'may', 'well', 'selling', 'car', 'intended', 'giving', 'dealer', 'profit', 'since', 'comperable', 'honda', 'profit', 'expensive', 'may', 'well', 'worth', 'buy', 'saturn', 'necessarily', 'seems', 'saturn', 'salesdroids', 'dont', 'make', 'commision', 'whereas', 'counterpart', 'dealership', 'generally', 'make', 'per', 'hour', 'whatever', 'mean', 'saturn', 'doesnt', 'give', 'profit', 'employee', 'commision', 'taken', 'per', 'car', 'profit', 'pas', 'along', 'le', 'pressureing', 'salesmenwomen', 'maybe', 'maybe', 'depends', 'accounting', 'practice', 'id', 'rather', 'pay', 'dealer', 'service', 'doesnt', 'cut', 'corner', 'contain', 'cost', 'cka', 'carolina', 'blue', 'honda', 'civic', 'dx']",yes point price competetive saturn may well selling car intended giving dealer profit since comperable honda profit expensive may well worth buy saturn necessarily seems saturn salesdroids dont make commision whereas counterpart dealership generally make per hour whatever mean saturn doesnt give profit employee commision taken per car profit pas along le pressureing salesmenwomen maybe maybe depends accounting practice id rather pay dealer service doesnt cut corner contain cost cka carolina blue honda civic dx

archivename recautospart new article as of february rpw many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics rather fewer know how to do it this article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard unix systems a shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a sparc here at balltowncmacom for a number of mailing lists note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list please let me know of the request address so that i can list it in the montly recautos posting also inform the keeper of the usenet listoflists check newsanswers for this monthly posting first of all to get anywhere you need to either be a sysadmin or have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin it is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else or that you have trouble getting email through then your network connectivity is probably not good enough listserv there is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv which is available from several ftp servers on the network details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably look at listserv carefully the alias file on a typical unix system there is a file named usrlibaliases on whichever file server is your mail host it contains lines such as foo bar baz bletch which means that any email sent the name foo on that host is redistributed to users bar baz and bletch thus the simplest possible email list is myfavoritecar member member member myaddress myfavoritecarrequest myaddress this has a couple of problems the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file however you can do the following with the connivance of your sysadmin myfavoritecar includehomemydirmiscautosmyfavoritecarlist myfavoritecarrequest myaddress where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses this file can be in the list admins home directory owned by the list admin bounced mail this still has a problem bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list which is generally considered somewhat irritating therefore the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup by the way im not sure where he got it from schoolrequest welty schoolrebroadcast includehomenewweltymiscautosschoollist school usrlocaladmbinexplscript school ownerschool schoolrequest ownerschoolout schoolrequest heres what is going on here the owner and request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network the request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties school is what people send mail to instead of pointing at addresses it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email schoolbroadcast of which nobody except me knows the name the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity points at the actual list members the shell script i use is as follows binsh cd tmp sed e replytod e senderd e from d echo replyto balltowncmacom echo errorsto requestballtowncmacom echo sender requestballtowncmacom cat usrlibsendmail om f requestballtowncmacom f the mailing list rebroadcast exit note that this script does not know the name of the list the name is passed in from outside so that the script may be used for multiple lists i run several out of this site the script excises replyto sender and from lines from the incoming message substitutes for sender and replyto and adds errorsto of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the request or owner addresses if this header rewrite is done for digested lists there is some digestification software around hopefully ill be able to provide more information in a future version of this posting

no that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city unless you have an accident you wont need more if you plan on paying for the car with a credit card check and see if your card automatically covers rental cars also your own auto insurance may cover rental cars also most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent and require you to initial in several spots if you dont want it the credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell i have never rented from alamo so i dont know if they follow this same practice yes it is a compact door probably a bit dull performance and accelerationwise but very adequate it will have an automatic transmission amfm stereo air conditioning and possibly power windows and door locks joe,"['sound', 'pretty', 'reasonable', 'car', 'city', 'unless', 'accident', 'wont', 'need', 'plan', 'paying', 'car', 'credit', 'card', 'check', 'see', 'card', 'automatically', 'cover', 'rental', 'car', 'also', 'auto', 'insurance', 'may', 'cover', 'rental', 'car', 'also', 'rental', 'company', 'offer', 'extra', 'insurance', 'rent', 'require', 'initial', 'several', 'spot', 'dont', 'want', 'credit', 'card', 'personal', 'auto', 'insurance', 'provide', 'sort', 'coverage', 'rental', 'agency', 'trying', 'sell', 'never', 'rented', 'alamo', 'dont', 'know', 'follow', 'practice', 'yes', 'compact', 'door', 'probably', 'bit', 'dull', 'performance', 'accelerationwise', 'adequate', 'automatic', 'transmission', 'amfm', 'stereo', 'air', 'conditioning', 'possibly', 'power', 'window', 'door', 'lock', 'joe']",sound pretty reasonable car city unless accident wont need plan paying car credit card check see card automatically cover rental car also auto insurance may cover rental car also rental company offer extra insurance rent require initial several spot dont want credit card personal auto insurance provide sort coverage rental agency trying sell never rented alamo dont know follow practice yes compact door probably bit dull performance accelerationwise adequate automatic transmission amfm stereo air conditioning possibly power window door lock joe
bottom line i did it and it worked some tips and techniques are included here i found that i needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks and a can of wd helped the sockets needed were metric exact fit but i was able to use some sae sockets and are rather close to and mm it can be fun having a canadian ford didnt have to undo the end boltsbushings just the u bolts on each side and the shock absorber jacking up the frame some more had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden platform on top of that to get the floor jack high enough to raise the frame it one talll truck lifted the spring free of the axel taking out the block gave me enough room to undo the pin holding the spring pack together the spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head on the other end no wrench head vice grips worked fine i soaked the nut with wd and it came right off flipped the bottom spring and then i donno im a little more sore today than after working on a a a foot pipe cheater was a real help torque spec for the u bolt nuts is to ftlbs a a doesnt have that kind of torque spec it was a challenge to get the pack bolt back in the spring pack squeeze pack with two hands hold bolt with third put nut on with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth and sixth hands i used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for alignment then i could let go to get the nut wrench vice grips getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too until i discovered that the axel had tilted andor rolled forward one the drivers side a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right hole on the passenger side i had to wrestle the wheel into rolling forward about inch to get things to line up spent more than an hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before i took a break and thought about why it wasnt lined up anymore since it had been lined up before and i didnt move it something else must have hmmm axle no longer constrained not to move hmmm move it back hmmm after that it was all much easier to close up btw the ride is now softer but not quite as soft as i was hoping for at least it now sits level e michael smith emsapplecom whatever you can do or dream

archivename recautospart this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast and so is not crossposted to miscconsumers rpw changes as of april revised brake fluid section as nonsilicone dot fluids are now apparently available rpw commonly asked automotive questions tire questions q what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean a typically you will see something like hr the is the overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually narrower the is the aspect ratio it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width our example tire has a sidewall height of mm the is the wheel diameter in inches there are also some special tires called trx tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like which is in millimeters the r means radial and the h is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate common speed ratings are s mph t mph h mph and v up to mph recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designations like r h the indicates the pertire load associated with the speed rating exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice what follows is a table showing a number of load indices and corresponding maximum pertire loads load index max load kg note that the usual mass vs weight confusion occurs in this table in some cases the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire size the lt designation indicates light truck and the p designation indicates passenger car if no letter is given then the application of the tire is passenger car usage as far as i know these letters only appear in the us market the lt designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles for the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at all if the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably but may be tires with an ms mudsnow designation may have their speed rating reduced by kmh about mph there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature traction and treadwear temperature and traction are graded a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear is a numeric rating these values are of limited value as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires q my car has tires with a funny size designation hr can i put normal tires on the car a your tires are called trx tires they were devised by michelin because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible with normal tires michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels and horribly dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner or possibly blow out at high speed trx type tires are becoming hard to find in addition to michelin avon makes suitable tires goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of trx tires q can i rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my car a car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok this group includes michelin and goodyear others for example pirelli and nokia will void warranties if such swapping is done the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturers recommendations q how many snow tires should i buy and if i buy which end of the car should i put them on a in short and both ends to explain many drivers in areas that dont get excessive snow or who dont drive agressively or at all in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice with a rear wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car a function of the front axle in a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end the primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards radar detectors and speed limits q why arent there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits in this qa posting a because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between miscconsumers and recautos always start long tedious and pointless flame wars if you want to talk about either of these topics please subscribe to recautos or altflame and keep it there safety equipment q do airbags really work a preliminary statistics suggest the following airbags work much better than no belts good point belts alone work much better than airbags alone and airbags point belts work slightly better than point belts alone the con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the drivers hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but not all may knock the drivers hands from the wheel making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult brake questions q do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned midas always wants to do this a no there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary if the rotors are not warped warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or to turn them note also that some rotors the rotors on many hondas are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped or badly grooved q they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down is this really a good idea a it used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade prone drum brakes in modern disc brake equipped cars use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases of long steep downhill runs otherwise modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings on the other hand many standard drivers license tests in the usa still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking i suggest that before taking a us drivers test you either learn to do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or borrow a car with an automatic to take the test q how often should i replace my brake fluid a probably more often than you do traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid dot type are older fluids dot and dot are newer specifications the principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid dot fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point requirements dot fluids have better boiling point requirements and dot fluids have the best boiling point requirements but dot fluids are not clearly superior see the next qa for more details while the requirements imply that dot fluids are better than dot fluids there may be specific cases where a dot fluid is preferable but these are mostly competition applications otherwise dot type fluids offer much improved brake pedal feel replacement once a year is recommended for dot fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly q what about dot brake fluids a this breaks down in to two parts the dot specification looks excellent for performance but the first dot fluids were silicone based silicone fluids are a tricky proposition unlike dot and dot fluids they do not absorb water at all while this may sound like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring the water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where most of the corrosion occurs because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to silicone fluids two other issues that come up with silicone fluids they are difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and while they generally have much higher boiling points than dot fluids they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling dot fluids silicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications and the economics are questionable for street use i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot standard that do not contain silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older dot and dot fluids but i have little information at this time q abs is available on some of the cars im looking at but it costs more is it worth it a this does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons the short answer is that abs costs more both initially and to maintain will generally work better for the average driver that is to say a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques and may require the unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case now for the long answer abs works by monitering the wheels of the car looking for signs of locked brakes it may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several systems on the market it cannot detect impending lockup which is what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of lockup the sensors used vary some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or oeequivalent components when the sensors detect lockup the abs system responds by unlocking the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the system if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the abs will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a sensor existed that could detect impending lockup then we could sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is achieved this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as the system cycles the percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the duty cycle typically in an abs system this is about on dry pavement a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking on wet pavement braking is so chancy that abs will outperform threshold braking nearly every time unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked only audi of the manufacturers producing absequipped cars has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this eventuality a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves steering control this is the case simply because if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel the abs will release the brakes if it sees steeringtriggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied braking distances will lengthen accordingly an important caution abs cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on glare ice dont expect an abs system to help you out very much the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an abs system in your car as far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential restrictions ive listed above you have to worry about the following parts costs are much higher the oe master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for but the oe master cylinder for the absequipped version of the same car lists for over most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot silicone brake fluids in absequipped vehicles because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid becomes very important q what about this threshold braking business a normally id not put this in the consumers qa but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in absequipped chevy caprices suggests that this section is needed here rpw threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab the pedal and lock em up panic habit entirely and is much to be prefered basically the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but just before the wheels lock up entirely drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this threshold feels like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal in many cars you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it in any case if you cant hear the tires whine just a bit youre not very near the threshold in a car with abs often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very close to the threshold and theyll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs take over recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with abs systems the police departments in question quickly blamed the new abs systems but according to autoweek magazine it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by pump braking an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system if you think about it for a minute youll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least so if you cut the duty cycle of an abs system by that much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs if you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient gas questions q does high octane gasoline help a maybe maybe not some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used on most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well check your owners manual for details on what your car needs q my car was made for leaded gasoline will unleaded gas hurt it a it is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although the amoco oil company argues otherwise the actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead you should however check your owners manual many cars from the early s do not actually require leaded gasoline q do fuel treatments help what kind should i use a some do and some dont during the winter it is a good idea to use dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems never use an additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection manufacturers opinions vary on additives containing ethanol sometimes called ethyl alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owners manual on your car before using these most manufacturers consider ethanol acceptable in gasoline additives with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol and petroleum distillates are fine in fuel injected cars an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain ethanol or methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank there are a small number of particularly good additives these are noticeably more expensive that the runofthemill ones but work much much better among these are chevron techron redline sl wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber and bg k a bottle of one of these once every six months is highly recommended q what about detergent gasolines a the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat bmw has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations if such gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits lubrication questions q what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean a there are several different items encoded there is a twoletter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil this looks like sesfcd or such the s codes are for gasoline engine applications the c codes are for diesel engine applications the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed thus sf is considered better than se se is considered better than sd and so forth the more noticeable designation is the oil weight this is either a single number eg weight or a pair of numbers separated by the letter w eg w the latter type is much more commonly used these days and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals the first number in the designation w is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold the w stands for winter the second number is the viscosity of the oil when hot there is a trick here the oil doesnt actually get thicker turn from weight to weight as it gets hotter what is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity of a cold weight oil as it gets hotter it doesnt get thin as fast as a w oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the viscosity of a hot weight oil note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not all w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all weight oils have the same viscosity when hot note also that the novel behaviour of multigrade oils is caused by additives and it has been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx w oils do not retain their multigrade characteristics well over time w w and w oils work very well though q are quick lube places any good a some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they dont overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all times q are oil additives like slick or tufoil any good a slick and tufoil are ptfebased additives many of these have come onto the market recently they are different from the molybased additives that have been around since the early s ptfe is the chemical name for teflontm a trademark owned by dupont in general auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products most usenet responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight increase of mpg after application smoother revving but long term results whether ptfe additives are effective after k miles are debatable some manufacturers such as saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage some bmw owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of slick to their cars this writer has been cautioned by a slick dealer that slick should not be used in japanese motors as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine otherwise there are no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives on the other hand there are satified slick customers in the world q do synthetic oils really work a yes but more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely amsoil redline and agip are very highly regarded and very effective mobil synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however q manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals how often should i change my oil a it depends on how you drive if your car always or nearly always gets warmed up and you dont drive it very hard and keep the revs down the manufacturers recommendation is probably fine if however you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesnt get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhaps at mile intervals given that most manufacturers are now specifying mile intervals if you dont drive your car much at all say miles a year then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway if you are storing a car during the winter then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage misc questions q my car has a timing belt i hear that bad things happen when they break whats the story a it depends on the internal design of the motor early ford escorts for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt some honda motors will not be damaged but others will be if no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the belt at least every miles some cars may require more frequent replacement ask your dealer or independent mechanic also ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time for example the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake q why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks a for performance reasons compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles q what causes unintended acceleration a the final report of the national highway transportation and safety administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence the nhtsa report goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator is probably the cause,"['archivename', 'recautospart', 'article', 'one', 'pair', 'article', 'containing', 'commonly', 'asked', 'automotive', 'question', 'article', 'contains', 'question', 'geared',

my knowledge about driving in the us is also secondhand but i think i can correct your statements about our autobahn oh yeah that would be paradise in fact you can forget it from all ive heard from my us relatives drivers esp here in germany are much more agg ressive but not disciplined one of my relatives a la resident hired a car at the nuernberg airport and went about miles to our home he said then that he grew about year older during this ride and swore hed never drive a car in germany again this was in and he kept his promise the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic what you mean by better disciplined should perhaps be considered cautious due to fear when driving around here you always have to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you they expect that nobody fails or sleeps many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go of course only where that is allowed you might think dream on so any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health and if youre ex posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver you learn to handle it or you lose thats the way i and most people i know experience our traffic situation whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you i think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest compared to the volume and decreasing rates of lethal accidents otoh more and more people esp women dislike driving because they feel overtaxed and threatened and each accident is one accident too much better designed and maintained may be but animal fences are very rare auto bahnen and many other streets have guardrails i hope thats the right word a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights its about feet high those guardrails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road smaller animals can crawl under the plank bigger ones can easily jump over it the point is that esp larger animals are very rare in germany they tend also to be very timid accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger youre right there are speed linits even on the major part of the autobahn but the attitude towards driving see above seems to be very similar to that in germany ive been in france switzerland italy austria spain belgium the netherlands besides that you really cant rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits ive got quite a lot of practise k miles and im used to travel at mph fyi with a car even smaller than a rabbit but i consider driving on the highways round paris or milano really a thrill sorry but youll find quite a lot rabbitclasscar or even smaller mine is a peugeot owners going that fast small cars with much hp are very hip over here and most people buying such cars arent afraid to let them run i disagree the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant formula cars weigh less than kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at mph or higher otoh when crashing against a solid object at mph it makes no difference whether you sit in a porsche a mercedes a tank or on a bicycle yourre dead bye stefan stefan dalibor

in article several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for r you dont hear about them because the mobile air conditioning society macs that is the people who stand to rake in that to per retrofit per automobile have mounted an organized campaign to squash those r substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether on very shaky technical grounds at best on outright lies at worst now im not saying youre wrong because i know that the r substitutes exist but this sounds a lot like the mpg carbs that the oil companies keep us all from getting it sounds crazy but its true one of the best r subsitutes ghg is currently a commercial product unfortunately the sae committee on mobile air conditioning is comprised almost exclusively of macs members such being the case no papers about any alternative refrigerant other than ra have been accepted for reviewpublication yo john you want to provide some more details or should i just repost your voluminous repost later chris behanna dod hd fxwg wide glide jubilees red lady behannasylnjneccom cbt baby bike disclaimer now why would nec zx needs a name agree with any of this anyway i was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs we here are very interested in info on r substitutes in fact i think we really need all the info on this we can get i would really appreciate technical supply and hardwareupgrade details also r is a useful solventreagent in the extractionproduction of certain pharmaceuticals any info on the substitutes corresponding usefullness i am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure we are compliant with the regulations the trouble with regulations is that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do not what you should do instead i think the cause of the new regulations is the montreal protocol which has a definite cfcphaseout schedule of course the cause of the montreal protocol was all the research done on the causes of the ozone depletion problem someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast to ban the ozonedepleting cfc chemicals and not gasolines and other greenhousegasproducing compounds the greenhouse effect produced by infraredtrapping gasses like co and methane and the ozonehole problem produced by longlived chlorinecontaining molecules are not the same thing it is a lot easier to do something about not using the cfcs chlorofluorocarbons than it is to stop producing co and methane which are natural byproducts of combustion and of living animal organisms planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help the greenhousegas problem but would do nothing for the ozone problem fred w bach operations group internet musicerichtriumfca triumf triuniversity meson facility voice loc

while not exactly a service incident i had a similar experience recently when i bought a new truck i had picked out the vehicle i wanted and after a little haggling we agreed on a price i wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them id be back that evening to pick up the truck when i returned i had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could get to me when i finally got in there everything went smoothly until he started adding up the numbers he then discovered that they had miscalculated the tax license by about he then said he needed another from me i said we had already agreed on a price and it was their problem i wasnt giving them any more money the finance guy then brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time i reminded him that i was the customer and i didnt think i should be treated like that and that if he didnt back off he could forget the whole deal he made some smart remark so i told him where he could stick it snatched back my check and left needless to say they were not pleased by the turn of events early the next morning i got a call from the general sales manager wanting to know what happened i related the story and he apologised profusely and asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind i told him that if they gave me the truck for free i probably still wouldnt take it that there were other dealers in town i was a repeat customer of theirs and that they should learn how to treat customersetcetci was still pretty steamed about the whole affair he gave me the line about hating to lose a customer and they would try to find a solution etc etc i told him not to bother thanks id go somewhere else a couple hours later the owner of the dealership called me all apologetic etc etc etc and said that they would cover the plus knock another off the price of the truck i told him id think about it and he gave me his private direct phone number his secretarys name and assured me that they valued me as a customer etc etc etc i thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we decided what the hellthat was a pretty decent deal so i called him back and accepted his offer when i went back the next day to pick up the truck i received the royal treatment everyone seemed to know about the incident even the lot boy everything went smoothly and i was out of there in my new truck in about mins so i guess im a reasonably satisfied customer however it should not have happened in the first place i was a bit shocked to have a sales person talk to me like that i dont expect them to bow and grovel but i sure dont expect to be given a hard time either esp when its their mistake anyway im happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first years license fee im not sure whether ill go back to that dealer tho,"['exactly', 'service', 'incident', 'similar', 'experience', 'recently', 'bought',

my friend brought a subaru svx recently i had drove it for couples times and i think its a great car esp on snow however when she took it to a local subaru dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about dollars the dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour at first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price so is there any svx owner out there that has the same problem and if the oil change story is true then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me by the way the car looks great,"['friend', 'brought', 'subaru', 'svx', 'recently', 'drove', 'couple', 'time', 'think', 'great', 'car', 'esp', 'snow', 'however', 'took', 'local', 'subaru', 'dealer', 'oil', 'change', 'bill', 'came', 'dollar', 'dealer', 'told', 'u', 'change', 'oil', 'filter', 'svx', 'necessary', 'disassemble', 'metal', 'cover', 'engine', 'took', 'hour', 'labour', 'first', 'think', 'ripped', 'phone', 'dealer', 'toronto', 'found', 'charging', 'roughly', 'price', 'svx', 'owner', 'problem', 'oil', 'change', 'story', 'true', 'engineer', 'subaru', 'look', 'pretty', 'stubid', 'way', 'car', 'look', 'great']",friend brought subaru svx recently drove couple time think great car esp snow however took local subaru dealer oil change bill came dollar dealer told u change oil filter svx necessary disassemble metal cover engine took hour labour first think ripped phone dealer toronto found charging roughly price svx owner problem oil change story true engineer subaru look pretty stubid way car look great

thats nothing when a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldnt give her the bimbo treatment her first choice was a mazda and second choice was a nissan sentra we went to a mazda dealership and described what we wanted we started negotiating on the price and the salesdroid kept playing the let me run this price by the sales manager after playing the good salesman bad salesman game we finally told him that if he didnt have the authority to negotiate a price perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did he brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book read remar suttons dont get taken every time for a list finally after playing a few more rounds of youll have to work with us on this price also known as each time you come up a thousand dollars well come down ten the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies stood up and said well we cant come down any more so i guess we cant help you and they trouped out of the room leaving us sitting in the salesmans office all by ourselves hmm id read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer and i mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door for lack of anything better to do i picked up the phone on the desk and called another mazda dealership asked for a salesman and began discussing what kind of price they would consider a few sentences into the conversation mr salesmanager broke into the line and began telling me how rude he thought it was that i would call another dealership from his phone i said that since hed announced that our business was over he shouldnt care and every time i tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own how did he know that i was using the phone anyway finally i hung up and we headed out of the showroom sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again we say that we wont bother him anymore were going next door to the nissan dealership then comes the part i wish i could have videotaped as we go out the front door the sales manager shouts across the entire showroom

this is turning into a faq here is how to violate your quadra warranty and install your own memory insert usual disclaimer here remove the top lid of the machine you will see the floppy disk and hard drive mounted in a plastic tower follow the usual antistatic precautions and of course make sure the machine is off when you do this unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back of the mac remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up the tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply you may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power supply leave that alone the plastic tab from the tower is all you need release look at the rear of the tower assembly you will see the flat ribbon scsi connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy drive disconnect all these from the motherboard the hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release it unplug the drive activity led from its clear plastic mount look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic tower a phillips head screw is at the base remove it taking care not to drop it into the case a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful here remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower this tab prevents the tower from sliding posteriorly slide the entire tower assembly cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case congratulations you have now gained access to your machines simm slots the six big slots are for vram one usually must install all six to gain useful video modes all simms ram or vram installed with their chips facing the front of the motherboard the four smaller sockets in front are for ram simms install simms in sets of four into these sockets be sure you seat the simms squarely and firmly into a fully upright position reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about cm posterior of its intended position lower the tower assembly into place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case once fully down slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks into place reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables dontt forget the floppy drive cable replace the phillips head screw drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount,"['turning', 'faq', 'violate', 'quadra', 'warranty', 'install', 'memory', 'insert', 'usual', 'disclaimer',

theres absolutely no reason why differences in the dram access time alone would cause an incompatibility there would have to be another difference between the simms for there to be a problem ive often used memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever as long as its as fast or faster than the minimum requirement you should be fine just out of curiosity did you actually try this and see a problem or were you told it wouldnt work and so never tried it also out of curiosity do you know exactly who in cupertino you dealer talked to as id like to find out what theyre basing this recommendation on,"['there', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'difference', 'dram', 'access', 'time', 'alone', 'would', 'cause', 'incompatibility', 'would', 'another', 'difference', 'simms', 'problem', 'ive', 'often', 'used', 'memory', 'different', 'speed', 'problem', 'whatsoever', 'long', 'fast', 'faster', 'minimum', 'requirement', 'fine', 'curiosity', 'actually', 'try', 'see', 'problem', 'told', 'wouldnt', 'work', 'never', 'tried', 'also', 'curiosity', 'know', 'exactly', 'cupertino', 'dealer', 'talked', 'id', 'like', 'find', 'theyre', 'basing', 'recommendation']",there absolutely reason difference dram access time alone would cause incompatibility would another difference simms problem ive often used memory different speed problem whatsoever long fast faster minimum requirement fine curiosity actually try see problem told wouldnt work never tried also curiosity know exactly cupertino dealer talked id like find theyre basing recommendation

i just recently bought a mb ram card for my original mac portable backlit and have since had some bizarre crashes it happens when i put the machine to sleep and wake the machine up sometimes it will just freeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset switch other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error message of co processor not installed i know one solution is not to put the machine to sleep but does anyone have any ideas on what could be causing this or better yet what might fix it the memory card is psuedostatic ram and goes into the pds slot that probably figures into the problem the manufacturer is king memory not kingston from irvine ca they say the problem is in my machine any ideas gene wright,"['recently', 'bought', 'mb', 'ram', 'card', 'original', 'mac', 'portable', 'backlit', 'since', 'bizarre', 'crash', 'happens', 'put', 'machine', 'sleep', 'wake', 'machine', 'sometimes', 'freeze', 'cursor', 'lock', 'machine', 'forcing', 'push', 'reset', 'switch', 'time', 'give', 'usual', 'bomb', 'box', 'error', 'message', 'co', 'processor', 'installed', 'know', 'one', 'solution', 'put', 'machine', 'sleep', 'anyone', 'idea', 'could', 'causing', 'better', 'yet', 'might', 'fix', 'memory', 'card', 'psuedostatic', 'ram', 'go', 'pd', 'slot', 'probably', 'figure', 'problem', 'manufacturer', 'king', 'memory', 'kingston', 'irvine', 'ca', 'say', 'problem', 'machine', 'idea', 'gene', 'wright']",recently bought mb ram card original mac portable backlit since bizarre crash happens put machine sleep wake machine sometimes freeze cursor lock machine forcing push reset switch time give usual bomb box error message co processor installed know one solution put machine sleep anyone idea could causing better yet might fix memory card psuedostatic ram go pd slot probably figure problem manufacturer king memory kingston irvine ca say problem machine idea gene wright

to the best of my knowledge there arent any problems with quadras and blind transfers trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the tibs or didnt test their driver with the device in question well designed tibs poll or loop at every point where delays of sec occur this usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can hiccup in the middle of blocks if this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going in anycase the scsi manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync actual data loss would only occur if the driver didnt pay attention to the errors coming back note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the scsi bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the scsi manager the problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the scsi chip when the next byte hasnt been clocked yet also note that the bus error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesnt crash the machine,"['best', 'knowledge', 'arent', 'problem', 'quadras', 'blind', 'transfer', 'trouble', 'blind', 'transfer', 'usually', 'mean', 'programmer', 'screwed', 'tib', 'didnt', 'test', 'driver', 'device', 'question', 'well', 'designed', 'tib', 'poll', 'loop', 'every', 'point', 'delay', 'sec', 'occur', 'usually', 'occurs', 'first', 'byte', 'block', 'transfer', 'device', 'hiccup', 'middle', 'block', 'happens', 'middle', 'blind', 'transfer', 'possibility', 'losing', 'gaining', 'byte', 'depending', 'direction', 'tranfer', 'going', 'anycase', 'scsi', 'manager', 'eventually', 'return', 'phase', 'error', 'end', 'transaction', 'sync', 'actual', 'data', 'loss', 'would', 'occur', 'driver', 'didnt', 'pay', 'attention', 'error', 'coming', 'back', 'note', 'effect', 'caused', 'anything', 'actually', 'scsi', 'bus', 'rather', 'transfer', 'loop', 'inside', 'scsi', 'manager', 'problem', 'occurs', 'processor', 'bus', 'error', 'trying', 'access', 'scsi', 'chip', 'next', 'byte', 'hasnt', 'clocked', 'yet', 'also', 'note', 'bus', 'error', 'dealt', 'bus', 'error', 'handler', 'doesnt', 'crash', 'machine']",best knowledge arent problem quadras blind transfer trouble blind transfer usually mean programmer screwed tib didnt test driver device question well designed tib poll loop every point delay sec occur usually occurs first byte block transfer device hiccup middle block happens middle blind transfer possibility losing gaining byte depending direction tranfer going anycase scsi manager eventually return phase error end transaction sync actual data loss would occur driver didnt pay attention error coming back note effect caused anything actually scsi bus rather transfer loop inside scsi manager problem occurs processor bus error trying access scsi chip next byte hasnt clocked yet also note bus error dealt bus error handler doesnt crash machine

i think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general the processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things i mean how can you say a is faster than a without giving is operational conditions can you say the same when you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions knowing that does not have transidental functions building in to its fpu and does can you say that is still faster anyway i hope people do not decided upon wether a computers is good or not solely on its processor or how fast a processor is based on its name because one can alway do a certain things to a processor to speed it up but if we restrict our arguements to for example pure processor architectural issues or how one processor will work well and another will not based on its design then we can get somewhere with our discussions chung yang,"['think', 'kind', 'comparison', 'pretty', 'useless', 'general', 'processor', 'good', 'good', 'computer', 'designed', 'around', 'adn', 'computer', 'used', 'designed', 'purpose', 'comparing', 'processor', 'speed', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'increase', 'clock', 'speed', 'increase', 'speed', 'among', 'thing', 'mean', 'say', 'faster', 'without', 'giving', 'operational', 'condition', 'say', 'running', 'program', 'us', 'lot', 'transidental', 'function', 'knowing', 'transidental', 'function', 'building', 'fpu', 'say', 'still', 'faster', 'anyway', 'hope', 'people', 'decided', 'upon', 'wether', 'computer', 'good', 'solely', 'processor', 'fast', 'processor', 'based', 'name', 'one', 'alway', 'certain', 'thing', 'processor', 'speed', 'restrict', 'arguements', 'example', 'pure', 'processor', 'architectural', 'issue', 'one', 'processor', 'work', 'well', 'another', 'based', 'design', 'get', 'somewhere', 'discussion', 'chung', 'yang']",think kind comparison pretty useless general processor good good computer designed around adn computer used designed purpose comparing processor speed pretty dumb increase clock speed increase speed among thing mean say faster without giving operational condition say running program us lot transidental function knowing transidental function building fpu say still faster anyway hope people decided upon wether computer good solely processor fast processor based name one alway certain thing processor speed restrict arguements example pure processor architectural issue one processor work well another based design get somewhere discussion chung yang

terminated it is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any macintosh if you can find the space to put it i have a iisi that came with a quantum meg drive when i ran into space problems i slapped in another meg quantum that i had sitting on a shelf here is what i did first off i was concerned about space since both drives are quantum quarter height drives i finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other fine they fit snugly i have not had a problem with heat yet and these drives have been running together for over two months the next problem was connecting the drive if you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as i did then half of your troubles are over just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors if you dont have a spare cable you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about i would suggest properly solderingheatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections next you need a ribbon cable connection again i had a spare hard disk ribbon cable and i wanted to be careful in case this didnt word so what i did was purchase a crimp on pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable the part cost again and is easily attached with any good wood vice the theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesnt work my original cable is not damaged and i can go back to the original setup having done all that

a professor of mine once said the difference between a computer engineer and a computer scientist is about meaning the engineer makes more than the cs seriously though the main difference is that most cs people write programs that people will use ie database graphics word processors etc while an engineer writes for machines or control systems ie the computer in your car a flight control system computer controled devices etc in other words cs writes software while cse writes firmware these are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is,"['professor', 'mine', 'said', 'difference', 'computer', 'engineer', 'computer', 'scientist', 'meaning', 'engineer', 'make', 'c', 'seriously', 'though', 'main', 'difference', 'c', 'people', 'write', 'program', 'people', 'use', 'ie', 'database', 'graphic', 'word', 'processor', 'etc', 'engineer', 'writes', 'machine', 'control', 'system', 'ie', 'computer', 'car', 'flight', 'control', 'system', 'computer', 'controled', 'device', 'etc', 'word', 'c', 'writes', 'software', 'cse', 'writes', 'firmware', 'generalization', 'part', 'difference']",professor mine said difference computer engineer computer scientist meaning engineer make c seriously though main difference c people write program people use ie database graphic word processor etc engineer writes machine control system ie computer car flight control system computer controled device etc word c writes software cse writes firmware generalization part difference

ben since youre obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works the only thing short of repairing it that i can think of is a thorough cleaning of all the parts and then checking for the proper placement of the little blue rollers since they arent fixed in position on their stainless steel pins you might try sliding them into a slightly different position on my powerbook i can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball in fact one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its edge contacts the ball not the center cylindrical area ive done this with my pb and it does seem to improve the feel but needs to be adjusted from time to time i just popped open one of our offices pbs and while there isnt as much latitude for movement one could still adjust the roller slightly if your pb is the same it might help i would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller if you can take it out clean it with a mild soapy solution or isopropyl alcohol also be sure the ball is greasefree if you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin if all this still doesnt solve it then maybe a new one is in order it could be an electrical connection in which case replacement would be necessary but my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem not an electrical malfunction hope this helps murray,"['ben', 'since', 'youre', 'obviously', 'adept', 'enough', 'understand', 'trackball', 'work', 'thing', 'short', 'repairing', 'think', 'thorough', 'cleaning', 'part', 'checking', 'proper', 'placement', 'little', 'blue', 'roller', 'since', 'arent', 'fixed', 'position', 'stainless', 'steel', 'pin', 'might', 'try', 'sliding', 'slightly', 'different', 'position', 'powerbook', 'slide', 'almost', 'completely', 'contact', 'trackball', 'fact', 'one', 'note', 'sumex', 'fixing', 'trackball', 'advocate', 'sliding', 'roller', 'edge', 'contact', 'ball', 'center', 'cylindrical', 'area', 'ive', 'done', 'pb', 'seem', 'improve', 'feel', 'need', 'adjusted', 'time', 'time', 'popped', 'open', 'one', 'office', 'pb', 'isnt', 'much', 'latitude', 'movement', 'one', 'could', 'still', 'adjust', 'roller', 'slightly', 'pb', 'might', 'help', 'would', 'suspect', 'likely', 'culprit', 'slippery', 'blue', 'roller', 'take', 'clean', 'mild', 'soapy', 'solution', 'isopropyl', 'alcohol', 'also', 'sure', 'ball', 'greasefree', 'drop', 'ball', 'minus', 'retaining', 'ring', 'roll', 'ball', 'see', 'actually', 'causing', 'axle', 'spin', 'still', 'doesnt', 'solve', 'maybe', 'new', 'one', 'order', 'could', 'electrical', 'connection', 'case', 'replacement', 'would', 'necessary', 'experience', 'mouse', 'trackball', 'dirt', 'normal', 'problem', 'electrical', 'malfunction', 'hope', 'help', 'murray']",ben since youre obviously adept enough understand trackball work thing short repairing think thorough cleaning part checking proper placement little blue roller since arent fixed position stainless steel pin might try sliding slightly different position powerbook slide almost completely contact trackball fact one note sumex fixing trackball advocate sliding roller edge contact ball center cylindrical area ive done pb seem improve feel need adjusted time time popped open one office pb isnt much latitude movement one could still adjust roller slightly pb might help would suspect likely culprit slippery blue roller take clean mild soapy solution isopropyl alcohol also sure ball greasefree drop ball minus retaining ring roll ball see actually causing axle spin still doesnt solve maybe new one order could electrical connection case replacement would necessary experience mouse trackball dirt normal problem electrical malfunction hope help murray

i think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesnt have an fpu it does seem to be an option even though it really isnt well then allow me to end your confusion the c only come with an lc in the base configuration if you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an fpu good question i have been wondering that since feb th this is possible but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it what apple has done is given the buyer a choice between configurations and not an option this is not unclear at all in fact apple has included in the roms of those machines with lcs code to recognize the presence of the full s fpu and use it thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips you pop the lc out and pop in a full they did i think i would doublecheck this it has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the centris hardware designers that the lc and the full are pin compatible and that the c can be upgraded to a full,"['think', 'mostly', 'fault', 'people', 'write', 'literature', 'price', 'list', 'confused', 'since', 'two', 'possible', 'processor', 'configuration', 'one', 'doesnt', 'fpu', 'seem', 'option', 'even', 'though', 'really', 'isnt', 'well', 'allow', 'end', 'confusion', 'c', 'come', 'lc', 'base', 'configuration', 'getting', 'configuration', 'getting', 'fpu', 'good', 'question', 'wondering', 'since', 'feb', 'th', 'possible', 'option', 'something', 'supposed', 'able', 'request', 'want', 'apple', 'done', 'given', 'buyer', 'choice', 'configuration', 'option', 'unclear', 'fact', 'apple', 'included', 'rom', 'machine', 'lcs', 'code', 'recognize', 'presence', 'full', 'fpu', 'use', 'thereby', 'making', 'upgrade', 'easy', 'switching', 'chip', 'pop', 'lc', 'pop', 'full', 'think', 'would', 'doublecheck', 'stated', 'countless', 'time', 'newsgroup', 'two', 'centris', 'hardware', 'designer', 'lc', 'full', 'pin', 'compatible', 'c', 'upgraded', 'full']",think mostly fault people write literature price list confused since two possible processor configuration one doesnt fpu seem option even though really isnt well allow end confusion c come lc base configuration getting configuration getting fpu good question wondering since feb th possible option something supposed able request want apple done given buyer choice configuration option unclear fact apple included rom machine lcs code recognize presence full fpu use thereby making upgrade easy switching chip pop lc pop full think would doublecheck stated countless time newsgroup two centris hardware designer lc full pin compatible c upgraded full

my friend recently purchased a lc iii and he wants to know if there is such a demon called nubus adapter for his pds slot the lc family of macs can only use pds cards they are not able to use nubus ah but why can some technicallyhip macslinger tell us what the difference is between pds and nubus is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into pds and ends in a nubus card cage at least marvins friend has not been able to locate one and neither have i what is the fundamental reason for this i think that there do exist nubus expansion cages im sure ive seen them advertised occassionally but i think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a lc and iivx so unless you need lots of nubus slots its not worth the bother of course it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive nubus technology isnt a special apple proprietry thing i have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from texas instruments so there is no problem building an expansion box the difference between nubus and pds is that nubus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer pds processor direct slot is just that here are all the connections to the processor you can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be but theres no cooperation you may be able to get double pds slot adaptors but you try plugging video cards in and just watch them conflict of course the extra electronics in a nubus slot makes it appreciably more expensive so guess why apple doesnt put it in its cheaper machines so yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice,"['friend', 'recently', 'purchased', 'lc', 'iii', 'want', 'know', 'demon', 'called', 'nubus', 'adapter', 'pd', 'slot', 'lc', 'family', 'mac', 'use', 'pd', 'card', 'able', 'use', 'nubus', 'ah', 'technicallyhip', 'macslinger', 'tell', 'u', 'difference', 'pd', 'nubus', 'impossible', 'make', 'gadget', 'plug', 'pd', 'end', 'nubus', 'card', 'cage', 'least', 'marvins', 'friend', 'able', 'locate', 'one', 'neither', 'fundamental', 'reason', 'think', 'exist', 'nubus', 'expansion', 'cage', 'im', 'sure', 'ive', 'seen', 'advertised', 'occassionally', 'think', 'main', 'problem', 'cost', 'much', 'difference', 'price', 'say', 'lc', 'iivx', 'unless', 'need', 'lot', 'nubus', 'slot', 'worth', 'bother', 'course', 'may', 'extra', 'box', 'expensive', 'one', 'buy', 'expensive', 'nubus', 'technology', 'isnt', 'special', 'apple', 'proprietry', 'thing', 'sneaky', 'feeling', 'licensed', 'texas', 'instrument', 'problem', 'building', 'expansion', 'box', 'difference', 'nubus', 'pd', 'nubus', 'clever', 'interface', 'lot', 'neat', 'toy', 'built', 'make', 'sure', 'lot', 'card', 'work', 'together', 'computer', 'pd', 'processor', 'direct', 'slot', 'connection', 'processor', 'anything', 'quick', 'there', 'cooperation', 'may', 'able', 'get', 'double', 'pd', 'slot', 'adaptor', 'try', 'plugging', 'video', 'card', 'watch', 'conflict', 'course', 'extra', 'electronics', 'nubus', 'slot', 'make', 'appreciably', 'expensive', 'guess', 'apple', 'doesnt', 'put', 'cheaper', 'machine', 'yah', 'pay', 'yer', 'money', 'yah', 'take', 'yah', 'choice']",friend recently purchased lc iii want know demon called nubus adapter pd slot lc family mac use pd card able use nubus ah technicallyhip macslinger tell u difference pd nubus impossible make gadget plug pd end nubus card cage least marvins friend able locate one neither fundamental reason think exist nubus expansion cage im sure ive seen advertised occassionally think main problem cost much difference price say lc iivx unless need lot nubus slot worth bother course may extra box expensive one buy expensive nubus technology isnt special apple proprietry thing sneaky feeling licensed texas instrument problem building expansion box difference nubus pd nubus clever interface lot neat toy built make sure lot card work together computer pd processor direct slot connection processor anything quick there cooperation may able get double pd slot adaptor try plugging video card watch conflict course extra electronics nubus slot make appreciably expensive guess apple doesnt put cheaper machine yah pay yer money yah take yah choice

radius speculated publicly that they could provide a powerpcbased rocket for existing macs it would have the plus of rocketshare and the minus of nubus accelerators no true boot off the accelerator nubus bottleneck to video and other io apple it seems will not compete with third parties here except perhaps for notyetavailable macs like cyclone where a powerpc slot might be advertised look for daystar and such to make powerpc accelerators one potential problem with any accelerator though is that it will need a rom companion and apple has licensed only radius with rocketshare to use any of its proprietary code apple is between the lines trying to let us know that powerpc macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of risc and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing macs perhaps then well see groundbreaking prices in maclogic board upgrades much the same way weve seen much cheaper highperformance cpus this year first generation powerpcs s will also hopefully have socketed cpus so that theyll be chip upgradeable to s a year later this should be possible in much the same way that s can be pulled for clock doublers if there is too much technical baggage which i doubt since the external busses are the same sizewidth to do this perhaps we can have cpu daughterboard a la powerbook as standard to facilitate better cpu upgrades this is an area where apple has fallen far behing the intelbased world perhaps catchup is in order by the way last weeks pc week had an excellent story on powerpc pentium mips r dec alpha the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future worth reading for technojunkies also the latest pc has a cover story on pentium read it and all the other stories about how intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now once anyone is this secure they are due to fall intels market position will never again be as dominant as it is today especially if amd gets the go ahead to sell its s this week as it appears it might the competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle apple users should be excited that powerpc while not guaranteed dominance is a guaranteed winner even if

approximately four months ago i purchased a quantum lps hd from la cie for after two months the drive started having problems first there were intermittent freezes then corrupted files and resources then silverlining wouldnt even recognize the drive so i got an rma from la cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one well about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems often when i boot up my iisi i get the flashing question mark sometimes if i then insert the silverlining program i can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives at that point i can restart the iisi and boot from the hd ive called la cie again and theyve given me another rma their tech support people tell me that if silverlining doesnt see the drive theres a definite hardware problem given that this is the second bad drive in four months i asked la cie to send me a new one but they said no also within three weeks after i purchased my original drive la cie dropped the price on it by over i can accept that a drive or two may be bad and i know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs and i understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations nevertheless taken together the convergence of these factsevents have left a bad taste in my mouth i should have added above that when i asked la cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will sendi think the data is still in good shape and ill have to again reinstall everything from floppiesthey said it would cost me for data recovery it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still covered under a day warranty should be new i feel a little helpless about all this i dont mean to necessarily flame la cietheir support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful but cmon sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way i sent a letter to la cies customer service when the first drive was returned and i asked them for a credit on the price difference since i had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price i told them i would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another la cie product they didnt even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other whats the moral of this story im not sure but i do know i wont buy any other products from la cie in the future bill krauthammer

it clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many cases it will do fine the critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency maximum about action potentials per seconds and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal shape so the resolution of about you get with an bit convertor is more then sufficient ac coupling does not have to be a problem either since in many cases you are not interested in the dc level my pre amplifier is ac coupled also the critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass if the cutoff point is to high the action potentials will be slightly distorted but even that normally does not matter since it is the occurrence of the spike that is important however i do want to know what exactly i can expect before i start battling with the toolbox to get it going as yet i have no clue were to start looking for the technical specifications,"['clearly', 'depends', 'type', 'question', 'asking', 'many', 'case', 'fine', 'critical', 'information', 'neuron', 'firing', 'frequency', 'maximum', 'action', 'potential', 'per', 'second', 'amplitude', 'signal', 'detail', 'signal', 'shape', 'resolution', 'get', 'bit', 'convertor', 'sufficient', 'ac', 'coupling', 'problem', 'either', 'since', 'many', 'case', 'interested', 'dc', 'level', 'pre', 'amplifier', 'ac', 'coupled', 'also', 'critical', 'point', 'lowest', 'frequency', 'pas', 'cutoff', 'point', 'high', 'action', 'potential', 'slightly', 'distorted', 'even', 'normally', 'matter', 'since', 'occurrence', 'spike', 'important', 'however', 'want', 'know', 'exactly', 'expect', 'start', 'battling', 'toolbox', 'get', 'going', 'yet', 'clue', 'start', 'looking', 'technical', 'specification']",clearly depends type question asking many case fine critical information neuron firing frequency maximum action potential per second amplitude signal detail signal shape resolution get bit convertor sufficient ac coupling problem either since many case interested dc level pre amplifier ac coupled also critical point lowest frequency pas cutoff point high action potential slightly distorted even normally matter since occurrence spike important however want know exactly expect start battling toolbox get going yet clue start looking technical specification

this can be caused by two one of two things the first and easiest to fix is interference from something around the monitor such as another monitor or other electrical device try moving the system to another location to fix that problem second because of the scan rate of the monitor it tends to synchronize with room lights and can cause the interference you are seeing try turning off all lights in the rooms around the system and see if that helps if not try moving the system somewhere else a third solution would be to get a apple color display it should not have the same problem the color is more suceptible to you can try calling apples new support number in the us at sosapple this number is for anyone who has questions regarding macintosh setup and compatibility and just went into effect for this extended support on monday april good luck,"['caused', 'two', 'one', 'two', 'thing', 'first', 'easiest', 'fix', 'interference', 'something', 'around', 'monitor', 'another', 'monitor', 'electrical', 'device', 'try', 'moving', 'system', 'another', 'location', 'fix', 'problem', 'second', 'scan', 'rate', 'monitor', 'tends', 'synchronize', 'room', 'light', 'cause', 'interference', 'seeing', 'try', 'turning', 'light', 'room', 'around', 'system', 'see', 'help', 'try', 'moving', 'system', 'somewhere', 'else', 'third', 'solution', 'would', 'get', 'apple', 'color', 'display', 'problem', 'color', 'suceptible', 'try', 'calling', 'apple', 'new', 'support', 'number', 'u', 'sosapple', 'number', 'anyone', 'question', 'regarding', 'macintosh', 'setup', 'compatibility', 'went', 'effect', 'extended', 'support', 'monday', 'april', 'good', 'luck']",caused two one two thing first easiest fix interference something around monitor another monitor electrical device try moving system another location fix problem second scan rate monitor tends synchronize room light cause interference seeing try turning light room around system see help try moving system somewhere else third solution would get apple color display problem color suceptible try calling apple new support number u sosapple number anyone question regarding macintosh setup compatibility went effect extended support monday april good luck

available from educorp for the cdtechnology one and comes with two mail in coupons for two free cds im not sure if the cds are good since ive only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cds shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland the cdtechnology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive which supposedly gives it a longer life and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust a toshiba brand drive is also available but i think the cdtechnology is better since you get the same mechanism and at a slightly lower price with two free cds the apple i drive sony mechanism is around a ms access time i think and a data transfer rate of kbsec i know it is the slowest of the three mentioned here it is not widely available except through the apple catalog which is bad at a price of only it is also multisession photo cd compatible i think the external model comes with free cds some of which are pretty good the nec drive has been out the longest it has an access time of ms and a data transfer rate of kbsec it is available from many vendors around dollars including educorp it wasnt multisesssion photocd compatible before but i hear that the current version that is shipping is owners of the older drives can get an upgrade it does not come with any free cds unless you buy it in a bundle of the three cdrom drives above i think the best choices would be the apple drive and the cdtechnologytoshiba drive the apple drive for its compatibility with apple products and the cdtechnologytoshiba for its speed and performance btw the models of the drives are apple applecd or applecd i internal cdtechnology cdt the toshiba brand name model im not sure but it is also something like with nec cdr im very happy with my drive and have had no compatibility problems whatsoever if i am wrong about any of the above do correct me but i am pretty sure of myself even when i think im not also some of you out there might notice that i have the same last name as the president of cdtechnology which happens to be in southern california my hometown however i am not a relative nor do i know the guy liu is just a common chinese name especially in southern california with the enormous chinese community besides one of my doctors in california has three steve lius as patients and another steve liu comes to my school and lives in the

or there okay i guess its time for a quick explanation of mac sound the original documentation for the sound hardware im documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware basically you jam values into all the even bytes from soundbase to soundbasex this was because of how the mac and some later machines generated sound was by scanning this block and daing every even byte the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines when the mac ii and apple sound chip was invented it was designed to generate stereo sound it was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented so storing bytes at the even values at soundbase meant i want to play a mono sound and so it was emulated but apple had since retracted the documentation on soundbase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation so apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound enter game developers the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games furthermore people who port from the ibm dont want to learn more apis so it has become popular for game writers to write to soundbase to make sound since it is very easy since the mac ii apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware and the only things they have in common are that writing to soundbase works on some hardware mac ii iix iicx iici at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound through both speakers on some macs quadra at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound on the left channel only both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons if developers use the sound manager and i think the sound driver mono sounds will typically come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware it is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only but no one does if developers write to sound base their games will only come out the left on some games the other problem the original mac ii only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker while the se mixes both isnt really related it is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines it only affects true stereo sounds sounds which are actually mono will play on the internal speaker no matter what machine you have now to more directly address the question the games you list and also hellcats super tetris oxyd and many more these are just what ive tested cheat and write to soundbase and so are only left channel on quadras other games you list and also pga tour golf civilization and more these are again only from personal experience use the sound manager and work fine on all machines the more of the story is to developers dont cheat really i am absolutely positively not allowed to do what i am about to do but im going say it anyway stop cheating on sound really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware the grace period is about to end the sound manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will work even better soon so use it in conclusion to doug it isnt a hardware problem at least not a bug to jon it isnt a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels if they do it the right way it is taken care of automatically if you cheat there is not way to make it work on all hardware have fun disclaimer number i dont work on sound here at apple im just pretty well informed so dont write me with sound questions disclaimer number if it says up above that i wrote anything like the grace period is about to end then it is a bug in your news feed since i am catagorically not allowed to say

a question in general about displaying ntsc through a mac if i understand correctly the video spigot can display ntsc in a small window as well as capture the data in quicktime format however if i want to use a larger window what are my options perhaps i misunderstood the video spigot review also i am not interested in quicktime i would merely like to use my mac as a television from time to time i have a nice sony monitor and i would like to use it as a second tv when my wife is watching sitcoms on our regular tv perhaps some of the video cards for the mac accept ntsc input i have a iisi and i am willing to buy a nubus adapter thanks in advance for any help,"['question', 'general', 'displaying', 'ntsc', 'mac', 'understand', 'correctly', 'video', 'spigot', 'display', 'ntsc', 'small', 'window', 'well', 'capture', 'data', 'quicktime', 'format', 'however', 'want', 'use', 'larger', 'window', 'option', 'perhaps', 'misunderstood', 'video', 'spigot', 'review', 'also', 'interested', 'quicktime', 'would', 'merely', 'like', 'use', 'mac', 'television', 'time', 'time', 'nice', 'sony', 'monitor', 'would', 'like', 'use', 'second', 'tv', 'wife', 'watching', 'sitcom', 'regular', 'tv', 'perhaps', 'video', 'card', 'mac', 'accept', 'ntsc', 'input', 'iisi', 'willing', 'buy', 'nubus', 'adapter', 'thanks', 'advance', 'help']",question general displaying ntsc mac understand correctly video spigot display ntsc small window well capture data quicktime format however want use larger window option perhaps misunderstood video spigot review also interested quicktime would merely like use mac television time time nice sony monitor would like use second tv wife watching sitcom regular tv perhaps video card mac accept ntsc input iisi willing buy nubus adapter thanks advance help
i had the same question for my lb nec fg monitor the apple guy said that their lb monitor is ok to put ontop of the centris and had no coment beyond that i was going to just put the nec on the box but then i got to thinking the monitor has a small tiltswivel base so maybe the weight would be more concentrated than with apples i dont know the area of the base of their tiltswivel additionally the cdrom drive is in the middle so i cut a piece of thick wood to about x covered it in a cream covered cloth and used it as a buffer layer between the centriss top and the monitor mick mueck mickmueckanalogcom,"['question', 'lb', 'nec', 'fg', 'monitor', 'apple', 'guy', 'said', 'lb', 'monitor', 'ok', 'put', 'ontop', 'centris', 'coment', 'beyond', 'going', 'put', 'nec', 'box', 'got', 'thinking', 'monitor', 'small', 'tiltswivel', 'base', 'maybe', 'weight', 'would', 'concentrated', 'apple', 'dont', 'know', 'area', 'base', 'tiltswivel', 'additionally', 'cdrom', 'drive', 'middle', 'cut', 'piece', 'thick', 'wood', 'x', 'covered', 'cream', 'covered', 'cloth', 'used', 'buffer', 'layer', 'centriss', 'top', 'monitor', 'mick', 'mueck', 'mickmueckanalogcom']",question lb nec fg monitor apple guy said lb monitor ok put ontop centris coment beyond going put nec box got thinking monitor small tiltswivel base maybe weight would concentrated apple dont know area base tiltswivel additionally cdrom drive middle cut piece thick wood x covered cream covered cloth used buffer layer centriss top monitor mick mueck mickmueckanalogcom
i have an se with a meg hd which dates back to april when i originally purchased it i experienced the failure to boot problem this was fixed soon after by a rom upgrade on the hard drive lately a similar problem has been occuring when the computer is powered on the hd light flashes a few times and then i am given the no disk to boot from icon however upon turing the computer off and on again the drive always boots up just fine furthermore if instead of turning the power on and off i press the reboot button the same problem occurs but as i said turning the power off and on always works this problem is different from the boot problem in that before it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how it can be fixed im wondering if its getting old and requires more time to come up to speed now is there a pram or scsi setting that allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before trying to access the hd thanks,"['se', 'meg', 'hd', 'date', 'back', 'april', 'originally', 'purchased', 'experienced', 'failure', 'boot', 'problem', 'fixed', 'soon', 'rom', 'upgrade', 'hard', 'drive', 'lately', 'similar', 'problem', 'occuring', 'computer', 'powered', 'hd', 'light', 'flash', 'time', 'given', 'disk', 'boot', 'icon', 'however', 'upon', 'turing', 'computer', 'drive', 'always', 'boot', 'fine', 'furthermore', 'instead', 'turning', 'power', 'press', 'reboot', 'button', 'problem', 'occurs', 'said', 'turning', 'power', 'always', 'work', 'problem', 'different', 'boot', 'problem', 'often', 'required', 'several', 'power', 'ons', 'get', 'boot', 'anybody', 'suggestion', 'problem', 'fixed', 'im', 'wondering', 'getting', 'old', 'requires', 'time', 'come', 'speed', 'pram', 'scsi', 'setting', 'allows', 'tell', 'computer', 'wait', 'little', 'longer', 'trying', 'access', 'hd', 'thanks']",se meg hd date back april originally purchased experienced failure boot problem fixed soon rom upgrade hard drive lately similar problem occuring computer powered hd light flash time given disk boot icon however upon turing computer drive always boot fine furthermore instead turning power press reboot button problem occurs said turning power always work problem different boot problem often required several power ons get boot anybody suggestion problem fixed im wondering getting old requires time come speed pram scsi setting allows tell computer wait little longer trying access hd thanks

well folks after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face why would apple release a duo dock with a processor of its own heres why people have hounded apple for a notebook with a processor in it apple cant deliver that right now because the saps too much power radiates far too much heat and is too large for a notebook how does one get around that without designing a new chipset use existing powerbook technology to your best advantage the duo dock gives apple a unique ability to give users that power in a semiportable fashion by plunking the into the dock youve got quadra power at your desk on the road that mhz should be able to handle most of your needs okay not the best solution but its an answer to a nowin situation so does this mean one will be able to use the powerbooks processor in parallel to the docks processor okay were getting really hypothetical now,"['well', 'folk', 'thought', 'answer', 'struck', 'flat', 'face', 'would', 'apple', 'release', 'duo', 'dock', 'processor', 'here', 'people', 'hounded', 'apple', 'notebook', 'processor', 'apple', 'cant', 'deliver', 'right', 'sap', 'much', 'power', 'radiates', 'far', 'much', 'heat', 'large', 'notebook', 'one', 'get', 'around', 'without', 'designing', 'new', 'chipset', 'use', 'existing', 'powerbook', 'technology', 'best', 'advantage', 'duo', 'dock', 'give', 'apple', 'unique', 'ability', 'give', 'user', 'power', 'semiportable', 'fashion', 'plunking', 'dock', 'youve', 'got', 'quadra', 'power', 'desk', 'road', 'mhz', 'able', 'handle', 'need', 'okay', 'best', 'solution', 'answer', 'nowin', 'situation', 'mean', 'one', 'able', 'use', 'powerbooks', 'processor', 'parallel', 'dock', 'processor', 'okay', 'getting', 'really', 'hypothetical']",well folk thought answer struck flat face would apple release duo dock processor here people hounded apple notebook processor apple cant deliver right sap much power radiates far much heat large notebook one get around without designing new chipset use existing powerbook technology best advantage duo dock give apple unique ability give user power semiportable fashion plunking dock youve got quadra power desk road mhz able handle need okay best solution answer nowin situation mean one able use powerbooks processor parallel dock processor okay getting really hypothetical
ok i have a record that shows a iisi with and without a kb cache its small enough that i will attach it i have also measured some real programs with and without the kb cache the speedup varies a lot from app to app ranging from to i think an average of is about right the subjective difference is not great but is sometimes noticable a simple cache card certainly does not transform a iisi into something enormously better i do not have an fpu the conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between k and k caches i bought mine from third wave for well under i have had absolutely no problems at all with it if you get complete speedometer runs for a k cache id like to see them lets check the conventional

the thirdparty media adapters are usually cheaper at least in toronto than apples i bought the adapters from asante instead of apple thats not true only the decstation comes with a thinwire bnc coaxial ethernet connector the and all have a single pin aui ethernet connector only i distinctly remembered this because when got the first and i thought all of them are going to be thinwire i eventually had to go back and ordered destas decs oversized version of an auitobnc adapter that must be used with a transciever cable for the rest of the stations my advise to the very original poster beverly is if all you want is to create a lan with two workstations and wont add machines to it ever go for thinwire regardless of the media type going for utp unshielded twisted pair wiring requires a concentrator which means extra money and i believe these units come with at least ports as for thicknet its a nightmare and cabling is expensive avoid it unless you have no choice eg the two machines are two floors parts on the mac side you will need one thinwire media adapter from apple or thirdparty macx make sure you get version wont run on system mactcp which comes with macx if you

give to each other for another example read on in the march th issue of macweek ric ford described a twoyear effort by liam breck to document and bring to apples attention a problem with certain

called back today wondering where my new mouse was this time i was told that apple had decided the serial number on my mouse mbfc is not within the undisclosed range apple is willing to replace and there is nothing i can do about it nothing that is unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth apples while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice please if you have

camps can be clear and accurate about what they are saying about their machines since computer technology is always changing there are always going to be points in which the sheet will be lacking or incorrect on information so please just dont say the sheet is incomplete or incorrect but also give me clear and concise information to make the needed corrections all prices are in us dollars to keep this data sheet organized please provide if possible article citations for the information provided or corrected and keep the opinions to a minimum as this is a general data sheet keep the info provided simple so i can understand what is being talked about and can explain it to others finally keep the information relevant to the section corrected for example os code in rom is software

standards pc week color supportdisplay mac mhz pixel clock standard all present macs support the use of bit color through bit color quickdraw in rom bit color quickdraw allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit xbit images in y bit color and retain all the colors of ybit color where x and y independently are or regardless of monitor resolution dpi color to dpi palettebook or monitor type including autosynchronous vga mcga and svga monitors with ranges including hz vertically and khz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor macuser aug older machines that supported color se ii iix and iicx had only bit color in rom and needed a software patch to use bit color macuser special to keep costs down and speed up most macs have only or bit display capability builtin but most of those can be expanded to display bit color presently quickdraw is optimized for dpi display quickdraw qx will change this in addition quickdraw allows in macs with a nubus slot more then one monitor to be used in any combination from two monitors showing the same thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the pictures vram video ram standard for present nonpowerbook macs handling of builtin video from a bit color palette vram provided runs a bit color x display expandable to bit color or a bit x display sound output standard in all macs since the k stereo sound became standard with the se ibm even though pcs have rom bios definitions of how the operating system interacts with the video hardware nan zou the use of drivers bypassing bios video hareware inconsitancies see super vga below and nonstanderzation of clone bios have left resolution of video display hardware os and program interaction up to the os and video hardware in question faisal nameer jawdat in addition ibm and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present matt healy nor a standardized screendrawing toolbox like macs qd as a result the os must be very well written to detect some modes especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly at present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program os print driver and monitor card that editing bit pictures regardless of color mode os and monitor typecard combination as one can do on the mac is impossible with an ibm for example one cannot edit a bit color picture done on a os with a svga monitor on a with vga bit color palette and dos and still have all the colors one started

bit ibm or a bit mac color palette mhz pixel clock mel martinez monitors use analog input incompatible with ttl signals from egacga etc mcga multicolor graphics array subset of vga that provides all the features of mda cga but lacks some ega and vga modes like vga xx dictionary of computer termsdct common on the initial ps implementation from ibm and some ps models svga super vga this is not a standard in the way the others were but instead was a catch all category for a group of video cards as such with each manufacturer using their own implementation scheme svga was chaos with people debating as to what is svga and what is not in an effort to make svga more of a standard vesa was established and is used in the newer units but things are still a mess video is either k or m today resolution of x and x at and colors are common newer ones since have the sierra hicolor ramdac giving bit colors at x some of the very newer ones can do bits per pixel usually at x speedwise too much variation some very slow western digital paradise based for example some very fast s c based for example some are soso like tseng et a very popular chipset some limiting factors overcome by mhz vl bus s linear address mapping were mhz isa bus at architecture where the cpu looks at the card through a k window etc other nonsvga standards a ibms own standard interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions like linedraw polygon fill etc in hardware some clone implementations from ati are the fastest video available today though some clone models do not have interlacing tms high end

rock solid images to reduce visual discomfort and is vga compatible up to x on os some monitor types usable by macsee mac section above for specific details expansion both mac ibm scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner nubus card expansion mac plus only some monitors and cdrom main problem there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and at the end any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm scsi devices per scsi controller bit asynchronous mbs ave and synchronous mbs max transfers difference is due to scsi software drivers fast scsi is a misname for bit scsi in scsi mode see scsi for details scsi devices per scsi controller in scsi mode scsi is fully scsi compliant and bit scsi tends to be implemented as a very fast scsi since it does not require the different controller interfaces in hardware and software that and bit scsi do transfer speeds are mbs with mbs burst bit mbs with mbs burst bit and mbs with mbs burst bitwide and fast since bit scsi can use scsi software drivers and hardware at bit scsi speeds and as such is limited to devices sometimes it is mistakenly called fast scsi bit fast scsi requires a scsi software driver and scsi electronics but can still use the scsi ports wide bit and bit scsi require a different scsi port electronics and software driver from scsi which makes them more expensive than other scsi interfaces mac scsi asynchronous scsi builtin standard since the plus even though apple developed some specifications for scsi controlers the os scsi manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both scsi interfaces as a result present scsi macs use bit scsi as a fast asynchronous scsi presently quadras are the only macs with a scsi controller chip builtin digital review oct v n p though they lack some other parts of the hardware like the wide scsi port interface since other macs require a nubus card to use scsi older nubus macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the nubus and cpu rumorsome cyclone macs june will come with a wide fast scsi port standard and have a rewritten os scsi manager ibm scsi scsi is not too wide spread yet generally not bundled with systems except as addon eisa and vesa local bus adapters avalable like the mac bit scsi is used as a very fast scsi by most controllers out there unlike the mac ibm has no exact scsi controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for scsi mac memory expansion with a few exceptions the mac has used nonparity pin bit simm memory expansion since the plus while pin bit parity simms could be used in these macs only special iicis could make use of the parity feature by convension both simm types are called pin simms the iifx used pin parity simms the lc iii c and q all use a new pin simm that is accessable by bits at a time and is used in ibms the mac does a complete memory check at startup by writingreading every memory location if something is seriously wrong with a simm the mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is since macs made before feb managed memory baced on data path simms had to be installed in pairs bit or in sets of bit the centris and quadra eliminate this with a new memory management setup that allows memory to be upgraded one simm at a time if the simms are the same size are used then the memory is interleaved across the two simms resulting in a performance boost on ram access macworld apr printers adbs and modems builtin interfaces standard monitor interface and sound input builtin on most present macs pds

handled either through the pds or the nubus unlike pds nubus cpu cards exampleradius rocket allow use of multiple processors at the same time this is like having two or more macs in the same box able to dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved each nubus card needs its own memory but most nubus cards of this type come with mb ram simms on the card standard ibm memory expansion parity simms nonparity simms some newer models do a mac like simm memory check or a dozen or so different types of memory boards hd interfaces limited to hard drives by design or lack of

currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized drives can have more than one hard drive esdi enhanced small device interface mbs throughput generally considered better interface than scsi in many ways but not common enough for practical consideration outside of hard drives device choices are very limited compared to scsi bus interfaces new plug and play isa and eisa

replace isaeisamca in development oses assumes full installation print drivers fonts multifinder etc and multiple application use mac k to mb of os and hardware commands have been put into rom this allows apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the mac os quickdraw menu commands print mouse scsi sound drivers etc in rom which require clone makers to use the rom chip or read rom on to disks which requires access to the proper mac since different macs have slightly different rom chips plus vs classic for example with key hooks for the os support interface in rom programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk os has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and therefore can write smaller programs this also allows apple greater control over hardwaresoftware standards and that the disk os can be smaller and with some of the tookbox command code in rom with lower ram requirements then a totally disk based os macs use masked rom which is as

instead of allowing free upgrades bundled with new machines for x upgrades otherwise the installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system fonts from the previous system inside the system file this can eat up any ram benefits and cause other problems apple itself recommends removing all fonts from the system file aux unix needs mb ram mb suggested mb hard drive and a or equivalent to run this bit preemptive multitasking os is large due to being unix and needing translators between it and the mac roms price note sound output was supported in oses to by many formats including the following snd wave asnd fssd qssn smsd soun dcd and dcfl in the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards snd and aiff which causes some playback problems for the old formats though most still play ibm machiness have little gui code data and hooks present in hardware for programmers to work with so most of the coding must be provided in the os since hard disks were slow the disk os code is read into ram in addition what little rom code there is also read into ram a process called shadow rom this results in faster implementation since ram is faster then proms or eproms having most of the os code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a rom based system due to the patches needed in addition it reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware support is needed side note the ftc charged that microsoft formed a os trust by not providing all feature documentation for its oses to developers outside ms and designing its windows and dos apps to fail under os undocumented windows and there is deliberate code in windows nt beta which causes the install to abort if os boot manager is present gregory hicks infoibmpc digest v due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the ftc judicial council for action against microsoft was a tie which resulted in no action rumorsthe ftc will presue the matter likely to the point of choosing a new member or whole new council in addition the government has turned down microsofts copyright of windows which would allow it to charge a fee for developers using their hooks pc week microsoft oses dos has a k barrier with its own memory manager a mb barrier with third party memory managers this bit os requires that each program must provide its own print drivers and be bit programs need to be dos protected mode interface dpmi compliant and running on a dx bit protected mode to

in a consistent numerical environment sane or standard apple numerics environment floating point numbers are bits long when an fpu is present and bits otherwise exceptions such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number do not cause an abort but are handled in a logically consistent manner produces the internal representation for infinity inf produces zero the above treatment of occurs in an fpuequipped machine even when sane is bypassed and the fpu programmed directly ibm floating point numbers are bits with a hardware fpu bits when emulated the way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever compiler or assembler was used for a program on older dos complilers exceptions could cause program aborts and would abort to the dos prompt at the point where they occured most present compilers handle this better result there is little consistent handling of numbers between dos windows and os programs nor between programs for just one os networking includes printing wysiwyg printing can be a problem with either mac of ibm machines especially if one sends truetype fonts to a older style postscript printer mac hardware builtin localtalk network port and a builtin printer port localtalk has moderate speeds kbs requires special connectors for each machine and up and can be run off of either the printer port to include very old macs or the network port standard today builtin ethernet is becoming common but many older macs require a pds or nubus card at about for each machine these cards provide three connectors and transceivers thick thin and baset for ethernet the macintosh quadra family and some centris models includes ethernet interface on motherboard with transceivers available tokenring has been a network option since software appletalk the suite of protocols standard with mac os which can use variety of media types appleshare client software included with the os as well and can connect to file servers such as novell netware com open banyan vines dec pathworks apples appleshare servers system file sharing machines and afp servers running on variety of unix hosts mactcp allows typical tcpip communications telnet ftp nfs rlogin a later version will have unix xopen transport interface xti builtin by the end of macweek thirdparty software to connect to nfs servers dec pathworks provides decnet support peertopeer file sharing software builtin to system see os section full server software is extra printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in the chooser changing printers is by selecting a different name in the chooser the same is true of connecting to servers printing bugs monaco truetype font is different then the screen bitmap font quickdraw qx is suppossed to fix this and similar problems ibm hardware localtalk not widely used ethernet and tokenring software novell netware banyan vines decnet windowswork groups appletalk protocols and appleshare subset of appletalk each of the msdos networking schemes are in general totally incompatible with the others once you have chosen one you are pretty much lockedin to that product line from then on windowswork groups is a little more forgiving and removes some of this problem novell netware is the biggest percent of the corporate market and in general is more powerful and offers better controlmanagementsecurity than appleshare but its also more complex to set up and manage this will change due to the use of the mac finder and file management system by novell pc week infoworld dec macweek printing very os dependent dos if its a single user then you plug the printer into the parallel port and dont worry about it tweeking may be needed with poorly written software network printing is not controlled by the system but is mostly implemented by the actual program therefore performance varies from one software program to the next windows x supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing jobs in the print queue but it always lists printers as active even if they are not this becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers on the same net because theres no way for software to reliably determine which printer is active right now windows for workgroups is more maclike and intelligent about this os maclike the os deals with printers with apps making calls to the os printing bugs due to poor programing some programs for all the above oses do not have wysiwyg printing this is the fault of the programs in question and not that of the os involved price issue this is very dynamic with mac providing more buildin features than ibm and ibm being more get only what you need then mac and price wars by both worlds the ibm machines modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware standarization which in turn requires oses and programs to be very complex to handle all the variation in hardware when one adds all the standard mac hardware features to an ibm builtin inputoutput sound support scsi pds builtin monitor support builtin networking standard mouse interface and nubus in higher machines the mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent equipted ibm machine especially since some ibm monitors can be used with macs which cuts some more of the macs cost macuser aug some prices using some of the info in this sheet and macuser

im in the market for a laser printer used printers are fine nonapple printers are fine but whatever printer i get must fit the following required features postscript dpi emough memory to download fonts the cheaper the better id prefer under nice things anything over pages per minute scsi output for a font disk smallish footprint dont care about postscript level ii networking its just for me and always will be color i know about freedom of press but ive also heard that its painfully slow i can tolerate about ppm but anything slower than that and im not going to consider the price savings worth it id be curious to hear peoples experience with it tho i also infinitely prefer laser over ink i used to use hp deskjets in my last job and wasnt impressed with the quality im a laser bigot and the first to admit it ill be using the printer to layout pages of a book im writing the page will include multiple fonts ps graphics scanned line art and maybe greyscale pictures not sure yet the quality doesnt need to be spectacular but it needs to be clear and readable printers ive been looking at used laserwriters the plus the nt the ntr its my understanding that only the ntr has a scsi out for a disk true personal laserwriter ls and ntr i have access to the apple employee discount i work for one of apples spinoffs so i can get these reasonably cheaply ive heard bad things about the ls comments im leaning towards the personal ntr cause it has a nice small footprint laserwriter select i hear it doesnt have postscript but i havent seen anything for sure i heard mumbles once about a postscript upgrade used hp laserjets ive worked with the ii and iip on another platform and they were painfully slow are they that bad on the mac ive seen ads for an epson ps laserprinter that is

the quadra goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware reads pram obtains all info from last session including the volume setting and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound and waits on the scsi controller to respond to the boot up code if the dram produces an error or a registers cannot be read from a device or the device corrupts that addressdata or control paths then if it is possible the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the sad mac sound this is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac if you cannot control the volume of the quadra even at boot up then i feel there is something incorrect with the logic board my quadra does not show the problems you are having,"['quadra', 'go', 'thru', 'extensive', 'initalize', 'routine', 'hardware', 'read', 'pram', 'obtains', 'info', 'last', 'session', 'including', 'volume', 'setting', 'executes', 'sound', 'procedure', 'startup', 'sound', 'wait', 'scsi', 'controller', 'respond', 'boot', 'code', 'dram', 'produce', 'error', 'register', 'read', 'device', 'device', 'corrupts', 'addressdata', 'control', 'path', 'possible', 'firmware', 'branch', 'another', 'sound', 'routine', 'produce', 'sad', 'mac', 'sound', 'general', 'breifing', 'start', 'procedure', 'typical', 'mac', 'control', 'volume', 'quadra', 'even', 'boot', 'feel', 'something', 'incorrect', 'logic', 'board', 'quadra', 'show', 'problem']",quadra go thru extensive initalize routine hardware read pram obtains info last session including volume setting executes sound procedure startup sound wait scsi controller respond boot code dram produce error register read device device corrupts addressdata control path possible firmware branch another sound routine produce sad mac sound general breifing start procedure typical mac control volume quadra even boot feel something incorrect logic board quadra show problem

the duo powerbooks seem to park the heads after a few seconds of inactivity is that builtin into the drive logic or is it being programmed via software any way to tune the iddle timeout that makes the heads park themselves i think the heads are being parked since after a few seconds of inactivity you can hear the clunk of heads parking,"['duo', 'powerbooks', 'seem', 'park', 'head', 'second', 'inactivity', 'builtin', 'drive', 'logic', 'programmed', 'via', 'software', 'way', 'tune', 'iddle', 'timeout', 'make', 'head', 'park', 'think', 'head', 'parked', 'since', 'second', 'inactivity', 'hear', 'clunk', 'head', 'parking']",duo powerbooks seem park head second inactivity builtin drive logic programmed via software way tune iddle timeout make head park think head parked since second inactivity hear clunk head parking

i agree completely but there was only a refund for people who bought the gc with a quadra i have seen an alpha version of an extension from apple called gc quicktime video which offloads quicktime compressiondecompression from the cpu to the am on the card so it seems it can be done even though in a developer article it states that the gc cant be programmed but they asked that any suggestions be sent in anyway,"['agree', 'completely', 'refund', 'people', 'bought', 'gc', 'quadra', 'seen', 'alpha', 'version', 'extension', 'apple', 'called', 'gc', 'quicktime', 'video', 'offloads', 'quicktime', 'compressiondecompression', 'cpu', 'card', 'seems', 'done', 'even', 'though', 'developer', 'article', 'state', 'gc', 'cant', 'programmed', 'asked', 'suggestion', 'sent', 'anyway']",agree completely refund people bought gc quadra seen alpha version extension apple called gc quicktime video offloads quicktime compressiondecompression cpu card seems done even though developer article state gc cant programmed asked suggestion sent anyway
also has anyone heard any rumors that the new docks the ones with the cpu will be better designed that this first batch i love my duo but installing cards in the dock is not much fun bob,"['also', 'anyone', 'heard', 'rumor', 'new', 'dock', 'one', 'cpu', 'better', 'designed', 'first', 'batch', 'love', 'duo', 'installing', 'card', 'dock', 'much', 'fun', 'bob']",also anyone heard rumor new dock one cpu better designed first batch love duo installing card dock much fun bob
